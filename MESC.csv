"You didn't expect it to be like this, I bet.",Client,sadness,undefined
Like what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You know what?,Client,sadness,undefined
It's disappointing.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I thought I'd feel better,",Client,sadness,undefined
relieved.,Client,sadness,undefined
I thought it'd be a lot more fun.,Client,sadness,undefined
And it isn't?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, it's horrible.",Client,sadness,undefined
"I don't know if I'm able to talk today, Paul.",Client,sadness,undefined
I shouldn't have come. I should have just.,Client,sadness,undefined

"I wanted to call it off, the session, but...",Client,sadness,undefined
I wasn't sure i'd be able to make it home alone.,Client,sadness,undefined
I took a cab here.,Client,sadness,undefined
My car's at home.,Client,sadness,undefined
"God, at least I think it is.",Client,sadness,undefined
"Yeah yeah, my car's at home.",Client,sadness,undefined
"My god, it's freezing.",Client,sadness,undefined
I came this close to knocking on your door and asking for a sweater.,Client,sadness,undefined
When was that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know. Maybe 5:00 or 6:00,I can't remember.",Client,depression,undefined
It was still dark.,Client,depression,undefined
I waited for the sun to come up.,Client,depression,undefined
I've never waited,Client,depression,undefined
"this long for a sunrise,",Client,depression,undefined
except maybe on a camping trip in fifth grade.,Client,depression,undefined
Thank you.,Client,depression,undefined
You know what I did?,Client,sadness,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I held my cell phone,",Client,sadness,undefined
and I watched the minutes go by.,Client,sadness,undefined
It felt like forever for one minute to turn into the next.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I thought to myself,",Client,sadness,undefined
"how stupiis this,",Client,sadness,undefined
dying on the street like roadkill outside your therapist's office?,Client,sadness,undefined
"I'm sorry, Paul.",Client,sadness,undefined
I should have called it off.I shouldn't have come.,Client,sadness,undefined
You should have come here.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
What happened last night?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well,",Client,sadness,undefined
what didn't happen?,Client,sadness,undefined
The long version or the bottom line?,Client,sadness,undefined
Because the bottom line is very simple.,Client,sadness,undefined
My life is over.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Then,",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
you'd better tell me the long version.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I left Andrew.,Client,sadness,undefined
We had a,Client,sadness,undefined
big blowout.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Screaming, crying. The works.",Client,sadness,undefined
"And at some point i,",Client,sadness,undefined
I called Alona and,Client,sadness,undefined
we went out for a drink.,Client,sadness,undefined
We had a few drinks.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Listen, I'm not here. I'm.",Client,sadness,undefined
I'm so totally not here.,Client,sadness,undefined
"You are very much here,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Laura.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, it's not me that's here.",Client,sadness,undefined
"Believe me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.",Client,sadness,undefined
I did some.,Client,disgust,undefined
I did some terrible things last night.,Client,disgust,undefined
I feel sick.,Client,disgust,undefined
But I don't wanna throw up.,Client,disgust,undefined
"It doesn't matter, it's no big deal.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What do you mean?,Client,disgust,undefined
It's vomit. I'm not gonna,Client,disgust,undefined
vomit all over your rug.,Client,disgust,undefined
"It's a cheap rug, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Let's talk about what's,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
really going on here.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
It's Andrew.,Client,depression,undefined
He knows i'm here at this time. Why is he calling me here?,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe he's worried.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were out of the house all night.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, right.",Client,depression,undefined
"If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with his shit.",Client,anger,undefined
Start what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"At the club, this guy.",Client,disgust,undefined
Oh my god.,Client,disgust,undefined
"He had corduroy pants on,",Client,disgust,undefined
Preppy Sweater.,Client,disgust,undefined
"A republican, probably.",Client,disgust,undefined
"You know can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here I mean,",Client,anger,undefined
I can't concentrate with this shit.,Client,anger,undefined
Just a sec.,Client,anger,undefined
"Laura, the call can wait.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Andrew gave me an ultimatum,",Client,sadness,undefined
either we get married or we split.,Client,sadness,undefined
He said he wants an answer in a day or two at the most or else he's out.,Client,sadness,undefined
"He said he can't take it anymore,",Client,sadness,undefined
"that he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him.",Client,sadness,undefined
"Not for real,",Client,sadness,undefined
that it's been two years already on and off.,Client,sadness,undefined
Blah blah blah.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I don't know why, all of a sudn",Client,sadness,undefined
he just started ranting and raving.,Client,sadness,undefined
We've talked about this stuff before.,Client,sadness,undefined
"But it was all in theory, if we stayed together.",Client,sadness,undefined
If.,Client,sadness,undefined
"And suddenly, out of the blue, I",Client,disgust,undefined
I can't even remember what we were doing.,Client,disgust,undefined
We were watching Tv.,Client,anger,undefined
"All of a sudden he just,",Client,anger,undefined
gets off the couch and grabs the remote and turns off the Tv,Client,anger,undefined
"and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says,",Client,anger,undefined
that's it. I can't take it anymore.,Client,anger,undefined
So out of line.,Client,anger,undefined
Promised he'd lay off the subject for awhile,Client,anger,undefined
and all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.,Client,anger,undefined
He actually burst out crying.,Client,anger,undefined
I've never seen him like that before.,Client,anger,undefined
"And to tell you the truth, it really scared me.",Client,anger,undefined
"No, it made me angry.",Client,anger,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because he's trying to manipulate me with these. These cheap chick tricks.,Client,anger,undefined
"Maybe he thought he would break my heart or something,",Client,anger,undefined
appeal to my.,Client,anger,undefined
"Shit, you know, forget it. I don't know.",Client,anger,undefined
I threw a tantrum,Client,anger,undefined
like a three-year-old.,Client,anger,undefined
"Screamed, cried,",Client,anger,undefined
told him to fuck off.,Client,anger,undefined
I told him he was,Client,disgust,undefined
a little piece of shit for doing this,Client,disgust,undefined
to me when he knows that I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I slammed the door,",Client,disgust,undefined
smashed his laptop on the floor. I killed it.,Client,disgust,undefined
I ran out and I called Alona.,Client,depression,undefined
She dressed me in this outfit.,Client,depression,undefined
"It's, it's not mine.",Client,depression,undefined
We went out for a drink,Client,depression,undefined
at a club that she likes on chester st.,Client,depression,undefined
"She tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.",Client,depression,undefined
And she said.,Client,depression,undefined
"She said I was Lucky,",Client,depression,undefined
that she wished somebody loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.,Client,depression,undefined
And then we drank.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well,",Client,depression,undefined
i drank.,Client,depression,undefined
"And, there was this guy at the bar,",Client,depression,undefined
and at some point Alona said that she was tired,Client,depression,undefined
and that she needed to go home.,Client,depression,undefined
And then that guy...,Client,depression,undefined
"Moved next to me and,",Client,depression,undefined
you know what he said?,Client,depression,undefined
"He said,",Client,depression,undefined
you look so sad.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I said, really?",Client,depression,undefined
"And he said, yeah, you do.",Client,depression,undefined
It looks good on you.,Client,depression,undefined
Looks good on you.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, whatever happened to",Client,joy,undefined
: do you have the time?,Client,joy,undefined
Or haven't we met before?,Client,joy,undefined
"I must be totally out of touch, Paul.",Client,joy,undefined
"What do you think? Client: I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?",Client,joy,undefined
I...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"And then,",Client,depression,undefined
"I don't know how much I had to drink cause he was ordering for me, of course.",Client,depression,undefined
"And then he, paid the Bill and he asked me,",Client,depression,undefined
"would you like to go somewhere else? And I said,",Client,depression,undefined
"yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.",Client,depression,undefined
So I stood up and I went to the bathroom.,Client,depression,undefined
He follows me.,Client,depression,undefined
"And you wouldn't believe it, but these were unisex bathrooms.",Client,disgust,undefined
Am I'm Lucky or what?,Client,disgust,undefined
"How do you mean, i'm Lucky?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I'm, I'm running away from a guy and I'm.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Yeah, you were trying to get away from the guy.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Right. I mean,",Client,joy,undefined
"I needed to pee, you know, by myself. I've been doing that since I was three.",Client,joy,undefined
So I realized i needed to make a decision.,Client,neutral,undefined
By following me to the bathroom this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I thought, fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.",Client,disgust,undefined
I ran away from one ultimatum,Client,disgust,undefined
and there was this guy with a hard-on giving me another.,Client,disgust,undefined
Suddenly I felt like doing it.,Client,disgust,undefined
I never had sex in a bathroom before.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, what?",Client,disgust,undefined
I should go and Marry Andrew without ever knowing,Client,disgust,undefined
what a good bathroom fuck's all about?,Client,disgust,undefined
"It's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?",Client,disgust,undefined
So you wanted to do i,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but not to get back at Andrew?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Just for yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's right.,Client,neutral,undefined
A girl being forced into marriage.,Client,neutral,undefined
"What's she supposed to do, die ignorant?",Client,neutral,undefined
So this guy follows me into the stall and,Client,joy,undefined
suddenly,Client,joy,undefined
I was horny.,Client,joy,undefined
Is hearing about this disgusting to you?,Client,joy,undefined
"No,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
it's not disgusting.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Go on.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"He unzipped,",Client,joy,undefined
"pulled down his pants,",Client,joy,undefined
and he stood there with his,Client,joy,undefined
huge.,Client,joy,undefined
"God, I felt like I was 16...",Client,joy,undefined
Touching it for the very first time.,Client,joy,undefined
I was really,Client,joy,undefined
surprised at how.,Client,joy,undefined
Warm it felt.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, don't I know that already?",Client,joy,undefined
And then he...,Client,depression,undefined
turned me around to face the door...,Client,depression,undefined
And he pulled down my stockings.,Client,depression,undefined
"He lifted up my skirt,",Client,depression,undefined
put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.,Client,depression,undefined
I realize this guy's very good at this. He does this a lot.,Client,depression,undefined
He's a real pro.,Client,depression,undefined
And then this...,Client,depression,undefined
guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing...,Client,depression,undefined
"In gushes, full volume like a racehorse.",Client,depression,undefined
"I thought of Andrew,",Client,sadness,undefined
"how he pees in the morning,",Client,sadness,undefined
making the same sound.,Client,sadness,undefined
My heart ached. I just...,Client,sadness,undefined
"It was so stupid, you know? I just felt",Client,sadness,undefined
so sad all of a sudden.,Client,sadness,undefined
And he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me,Client,sadness,undefined
and he's feeling me up...,Client,sadness,undefined
"I thought to myself, it's gonna happen any moment. And I just...",Client,sadness,undefined
I just couldn't do it.,Client,sadness,undefined
I simply closed my legs shut.,Client,sadness,undefined
I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it to Andrew.,Client,sadness,undefined
I just couldn't do it.,Client,sadness,undefined
Seems like quite a night out.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah, that's not the end of it",Client,depression,undefined
"because this idiot...I told him,",Client,depression,undefined
I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend. I can't do this.,Client,depression,undefined
And he laughs in my face and says boohoo.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And he grabs my hands and he says, listen, cupcake,",Client,disgust,undefined
you think you can leave me high and dry like this?,Client,disgust,undefined
Pointing at his dick.,Client,disgust,undefined
The least you can do is make it up to me.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I said to him, what do you want?",Client,disgust,undefined
You want some money?,Client,disgust,undefined
"He said, give me a hand job",Client,disgust,undefined
and there'll be no hard feelings.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And I said to him, what's the matter with you? Are you crazy?",Client,anger,undefined
"And it was just getting really strange. I mean, it was tense.",Client,anger,undefined
His tone changed.,Client,anger,undefined
And then I thought of you...,Client,disgust,undefined
What you'd say about it.,Client,disgust,undefined
I thought about us going through this in therapy.,Client,disgust,undefined
And what did you imagine us saying?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I imagined you not being able to understand it...,Client,depression,undefined
That you'd be disgusted.,Client,depression,undefined
Is that why you ran over here?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
To find out if...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I would be disgusted?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I didn't run.,Client,depression,undefined
I gave him the hand job.,Client,depression,undefined
Excuse me.,Client,depression,undefined
Are you okay?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.",Client,depression,undefined
Thank you.,Client,depression,undefined
"We talked about what happened at the club last night,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
but we never got back to actually talking about...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Andrew and that argument yesterday.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I don't wanna be put in this position.,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't wanna have this power to decide our future,Client,disgust,undefined
for both of us. I just don't.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What do you mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think that,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Andrew...just out of the blue,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"as you said yourself,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
came up with this idea of an ultimatum?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that you think might have brought this on?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing. I don't know. He just lost it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, shit, don't you know that men are the new women?",Client,anger,undefined
Obsessed with weddings and children.,Client,anger,undefined
And lately he's lost touch with reality.,Client,anger,undefined
He he thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started.,Client,anger,undefined
It's unbelievable.,Client,anger,undefined
But I thought you said,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
it came out of nowhere.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You were watching tv, then suddenly...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, we were watching tv.But before that",Client,neutral,undefined
we were having dinner and he had this look on his face.,Client,neutral,undefined
He had this sad look and I could just tell something was up.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, you can just tell, huh?",Client,neutral,undefined
"And I said to him, what's going on? And he said,",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know what I want. I just know I don't want,Client,neutral,undefined
"this on-and-off thing. So I said to him,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Sure, then let's just decide: either we get married or we split.",Client,neutral,undefined
So you were the one who came up with it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
With what?,Client,neutral,undefined
The ultimatum.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, he's the one. He had the problem with the on-and-off thing.",Client,neutral,undefined
Not me.,Client,neutral,undefined
On-and-off can mean several things.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were the one who made it specific...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Get married or to split up. That was your ultimatum.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, he had this thing with the on and...",Client,neutral,undefined
The ultim...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, okay,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I was the first one to say it, you're right.",Client,neutral,undefined
But he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want.,Client,anger,undefined
"And he said, you have a day or two max to decide what you want.",Client,anger,undefined
And I said fine. And then he started crying,Client,disgust,undefined
and blah blah blah.,Client,disgust,undefined
"The whole thing was really scary to him, I think.",Client,disgust,undefined
What about you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Weren't you scared?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of what?,Client,depression,undefined
Of splitting up.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I wasn't suggesting that we split up.,Client,depression,undefined
That's not the point.,Client,depression,undefined
So what do you think was the point of this argument,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that you may have initiated?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I didn't initiate anything.,Client,depression,undefined
"You may not have meant to, but you did.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It sounds like you wanted to bring this relationship into...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
crisis.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I know you say that Andrew hates uncertainties,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but perhaps you're the one who can't live with them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I mean, why did you choose this particular time",Therapist,neutral,Open question
to bring things to a head?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I did no such thing.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why now?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because he's right.,Client,neutral,undefined
Andrew's right.,Client,neutral,undefined
I am being unfaithful to him.,Client,neutral,undefined
You mean what happened last night,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
at the club?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Not just last night.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've been unfaithful to him for a long time.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why haven't we talked about this before?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think we have.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's been here all along.,Client,neutral,undefined
You mean to say you've never noticed it?,Client,neutral,undefined
You're surprised.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I'm not surprised.I just...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't follow what you mean.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
This isn't...,Client,neutral,undefined
the reaction I was hoping for.,Client,neutral,undefined
Not at all.,Client,neutral,undefined
What was the reaction that you were hoping for?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I had...,Client,neutral,undefined
Two scenarios in my head.,Client,neutral,undefined
In the first one you stand up and you hug me...,Client,neutral,undefined
"And you say, I love you.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I love you too, Laura.",Client,neutral,undefined
I've been feeling this way for a long time.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just wanted you to be the first one to say it.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then we make love.,Client,neutral,undefined
And the...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The second scenario?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's like the first one but...,Client,neutral,undefined
But without the sex.,Client,neutral,undefined
We just sit here together.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, I'm embarrassed to even talk about it.",Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, you're sitting there like a fucking buddha",Client,anger,undefined
acting like you have no idea what I'm talking about.,Client,anger,undefined
It's humiliating.,Client,anger,undefined
How long have you felt like this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
A year...,Client,sadness,undefined
From the first session. I thought it would go away.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I thought it's just an infatuation, that's all.",Client,sadness,undefined
But it's getting worse.,Client,sadness,undefined
You've become the center of my life.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Laura,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm your therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The parameters and the limitations...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are established and ethically defined.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm not an option.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

As an excuse,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to bail from your relationship with...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
With Andrew.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You know why I didn't fuck that guy?,Client,depression,undefined
Not because of Andrew.,Client,depression,undefined
Not because I didn't wanna cheat on him. I do want to cheat on him...,Client,depression,undefined
But with you.,Client,depression,undefined
You know why I didn't fuck that guy?,Client,depression,undefined
Not because of Andrew.,Client,depression,undefined
Not because I didn't wanna cheat on him. I do want to cheat on him...,Client,depression,undefined
But with you.,Client,depression,undefined
"When I was sitting there at the bar by myself,",Client,depression,undefined
I was thinking what would happen if you were to walk in?,Client,depression,undefined
"You'd walk in. You'd sit next to me at the bar,",Client,depression,undefined
you'd order a drink. I'd even...,Client,depression,undefined
I even tried to imagine what you would order...,Client,depression,undefined
"A shot of bourbon maybe, something...",Client,depression,undefined
"expensive, something fancy.",Client,depression,undefined
Then we'd start talking...,Client,depression,undefined
"What a coincidence it is to meet like this,",Client,depression,undefined
how awkward it is to meet outside the office.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then, without words,",Client,depression,undefined
"because we... We talk enough when we're here,",Client,depression,undefined
you motion for me to follow you to the bathroom.,Client,depression,undefined
And I do.,Client,depression,undefined
When I went into the stall with that guy...,Client,depression,undefined
I imagined it was you behind me.,Client,depression,undefined
That's what made it so exciting.,Client,depression,undefined
Then that guy started peeing,Client,depression,undefined
and it woke me up and I realized that it's impossible.,Client,depression,undefined
"I know it, I understand it.",Client,depression,undefined
"I tell myself that every time I walk out of here. I know it,",Client,depression,undefined
I understand it but I'm not sure that my body understands it.,Client,depression,undefined
I know it can never happen. I know it.,Client,depression,undefined
So don't worry. I'm not gonna start showing up here.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not gonna start stalking you,Client,depression,undefined
like Glenn Close in that movie.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not gonna...,Client,depression,undefined
boil your kids' rabbit.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not dangerous...,Client,depression,undefined
At least not to you.,Client,depression,undefined
"God, how can I go back to my life,",Client,depression,undefined
"to the hospital, to Andrew?",Client,depression,undefined
"Not to Andrew, when the only thing that matters to me is you.",Client,depression,undefined
Our time's up.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yes, it is.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I feel like I came here in the dark,Client,depression,undefined

I'll call you a taxi.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy

Rules?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Ground rules.,Client,depression,undefined
Anything I should know before we start?,Client,depression,undefined
Not really. It's more or less up to you.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy

"I'm sorry, should...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Should I?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills

A man in tune with everything around him so yeah I guess you should.,Client,joy,undefined

The best is really matter of personal opinion.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

And figures.,Client,joy,undefined
You're the best. I did my research.,Client,joy,undefined

I am the best?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yes.,Client,joy,undefined
It's nothing personal. I always go to the best.,Client,joy,undefined
"Dentists, mechanics.",Client,joy,undefined
"You know what they say: Save now, pay later.",Client,joy,undefined
"emhuh, So what do you think being...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
the best therapist entails?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you recognize me?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I... I don't.",Therapist,neutral,Others
"Okay, let me help you.",Client,neutral,undefined
The madrasa murderer.,Client,depression,undefined
Does that mean anything to you?,Client,depression,undefined
Wasn't that long ago.,Client,depression,undefined
A US Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Bagdad.,Client,depression,undefined
Naval intelligence identified the structure,Client,depression,undefined
as an insurgent safehouse.,Client,depression,undefined
A bunker.,Client,depression,undefined
Turns out it's a madrasa.,Client,depression,undefined
Let me tell you what that is.,Client,depression,undefined
It's an islamic religion school.,Client,depression,undefined
Boys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.,Client,depression,undefined
Sixteen of them dead.,Client,depression,undefined
Rings a bell?,Client,depression,undefined
"Yes, I remember that, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"So, that's me.",Client,depression,undefined
I flew that mission.,Client,depression,undefined
The madrasa murderer.,Client,depression,undefined
"So, do your surf the net?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, somehow...",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, it wasn't really somehow.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Let's call a spade a spade. A leak,",Client,disgust,undefined
probably another intelligence fuckup.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Anyway, I...",Client,disgust,undefined
I was identified as the pilot in that mission.,Client,disgust,undefined
And my photo is placed on fundamentalist websites.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that...",Client,disgust,undefined
asking for my head on a platter.,Client,disgust,undefined
Offering up the heaven and 40 virgins,Client,disgust,undefined
to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.,Client,disgust,undefined
Here.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Here I am. Now, it's not a recent photo.",Client,disgust,undefined
"It's a photo taken when I was 18,",Client,disgust,undefined
on a high school trip to...,Client,disgust,undefined
Europe... Holland.,Client,disgust,undefined
That city with the miniatures?,Client,disgust,undefined
Ultre... Utrecht.,Client,disgust,undefined
Utrecht.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Go ahead.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So while I'm sitting here talking to you a million fanatics are downloading,Client,neutral,undefined
my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.,Client,neutral,undefined
Silly motherfuckers.,Client,neutral,undefined
So why have you come to see me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Wow, we'll get to that.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Now, so you're probably thinking...",Client,disgust,undefined
What's it like?,Client,disgust,undefined
"He flew his mission,",Client,disgust,undefined
and he flew back.,Client,disgust,undefined
And he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You're probably trying to figure out, What went through his head?",Client,disgust,undefined
Let me tell you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"After that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.",Client,neutral,undefined
I go to sleep.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm dead tired.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.,Client,neutral,undefined
How do you sleep?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I sleep well, thank you very much.",Client,neutral,undefined
Knowing it was mission accomplished.,Client,neutral,undefined
"With great precision, let me tell you. See, I followed my orders.",Client,neutral,undefined
Which were hit my target and hit it on time.,Client,neutral,undefined
Time and target.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you know we have to hit our targets within two seconds,Client,neutral,undefined
of the estimated time?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's surgical.,Client,neutral,undefined
"That's one small window, and I have never missed it.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If I had... If I had failed that task,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience.",Client,neutral,undefined
And with the system.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I hit my target.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I sleep like a baby.,Client,neutral,undefined
How many...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
children...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
died in this mission?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The media puts it at sixteen.,Client,depression,undefined
And the air force?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"The Navy, doctor. Listen.",Client,depression,undefined
The Nany says nothing and why should it?,Client,depression,undefined
"It's not the business of body counts, it's about hitting our targets.",Client,depression,undefined
"We don't look back over our shoulder, belive me.",Client,depression,undefined
"We're out there doing thing so you can sit here in peace,",Client,depression,undefined
talking to people for a living.,Client,depression,undefined
So when did you hear the children had been killed?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The following afternoon.,Client,neutral,undefined
I heard it on the internet.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what exactly did you hear?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Anything specifically that you remember?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like what?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net.,Client,neutral,undefined
This was a moment. I got away.,Client,neutral,undefined
There's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.,Client,neutral,undefined
What king of stuff?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Mission review.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.",Client,neutral,undefined
Preparation versus execution.,Client,neutral,undefined
Every tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded,Client,neutral,undefined
and analyzed by the man.,Client,neutral,undefined
There's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's just stuff and more stuff.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's... It's like when my mother died.,Client,disgust,undefined
My father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Last will and testament, her office, garden,",Client,disgust,undefined
a lifetime of photo albums.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And every time I'd talk to him,",Client,disgust,undefined
"I'd ask how he was, expecting...",Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, that he'd break down...",Client,disgust,undefined
Finally.,Client,disgust,undefined
"It never ends, Alex. It never ends.",Client,disgust,undefined
Your mother left such a mess.,Client,disgust,undefined
'She didn't know she was gonna die.,Client,disgust,undefined
And that's all he'd say.,Client,disgust,undefined
"After less than a year, he met another woman and got married just like that.",Client,disgust,undefined
"So, how did that make you feel?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was surprised.,Client,disgust,undefined
A whole life together and not a single tear?,Client,disgust,undefined
It's interesting that you compare,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the death of your mother with this mission that you've just...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
flown.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's very clever of you.,Client,depression,undefined
But there's no relation whatsoever.,Client,depression,undefined
My mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.,Client,sadness,undefined
That mission was just another mission for Alex.,Client,depression,undefined
There is no comparison.,Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, look, that's over. And i'm back now.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm back at my home base and now I'm on R&R.,Client,neutral,undefined
What kind of things do you do for R&R?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Don't try to get ahead of me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm a runner.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was a hell of a runner in high school,Client,neutral,undefined
and i'm still a pretty good one for an old man.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I run.,Client,neutral,undefined
"With my fairy friend, this gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.",Client,joy,undefined
"And does he have a name, this friend?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Daniel.,Client,neutral,undefined
Daniel.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"We've been running together for a long time,",Client,neutral,undefined
between six and 10 miles...,Client,neutral,undefined
Depending on whether one of us is on his period.,Client,neutral,undefined
Only this time i chalenged him a little.,Client,neutral,undefined
There's no real good running in the middle east.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Not for the US military, unless you want a roadside bomb to blow your balls off.",Client,neutral,undefined
So I wanted to do some serious running.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I said, let's go for 15.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Then after 15 miles, I said, 20.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Now he didn't want it, but I said, okay, i'll go on my own.",Client,neutral,undefined
So he followed.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I said, You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.",Client,joy,undefined
He wanted to stop.,Client,joy,undefined
Little bitch.,Client,joy,undefined
But I wasn't gonna stop.,Client,depression,undefined
It was tough.,Client,depression,undefined
We were out of water--,Client,depression,undefined
We're on fumes.,Client,depression,undefined
"At 22 miles,",Client,fear,undefined
I had a heart attack and died.,Client,fear,undefined
A textbook case...,Client,fear,undefined
Straight outta med school...,Client,fear,undefined
Enlargement of the left ventricle.,Client,fear,undefined
"In accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.",Client,fear,undefined
"According to the EKG and according to statistics,",Client,fear,undefined
"I had a 97.3% chance of dying,",Client,fear,undefined
or 2.7% chance of living.,Client,fear,undefined
"Anyway, dead.",Client,fear,undefined
You actually died?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"In the clinical sense. No pulse, no brain activity.",Client,fear,undefined
Total clinical death.,Client,fear,undefined
But here I am.,Client,depression,undefined
"And now i'm gonna disappoint you, doctor.",Client,depression,undefined
Don't you wanna know why i'm gonna disappoint you?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Let me help you out. The light, the tunnel,",Client,neutral,undefined
"the whole life-flashing-before-my-eyes,",Client,neutral,undefined
"That's what you're interested in, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"But I am interested. Please, tell me.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I couldn't give a shit about it either.,Client,depression,undefined
But that's all everyone wanted to know about.,Client,depression,undefined
"My father, my wife...",Client,disgust,undefined
Everyone. They just wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.,Client,disgust,undefined
Just-- Such bullshit.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you feel that maybe you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
disappointed people by not having that experience?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That maybe...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"in some way, you failed to deliver the goods?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Nobody really knows,Client,neutral,undefined
Nobody really knows,Client,neutral,undefined
what was going through my mind during those last few moments.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.",Client,neutral,undefined
And what was going through your mind?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, I knew what was happening. You can tell.",Client,fear,undefined
And you're afraid it's the end.,Client,fear,undefined
In all that time until I lost consciousness...,Client,fear,undefined
All that time...,Client,fear,undefined
"I don't know how long it was, Maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.",Client,fear,undefined
"All that time, I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.",Client,fear,undefined
"See, I don't know how I remember this Something my grandmother told me",Client,neutral,undefined
when I was in high school.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And she said, when grandpa died,",Client,neutral,undefined
she found him lying naked in the bathtub,Client,neutral,undefined
with a huge erection.,Client,neutral,undefined
Now he was 92 years old.,Client,joy,undefined
She hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.,Client,joy,undefined
She liked it.,Client,joy,undefined
She said that was god's final gift to a man...,Client,joy,undefined
A dead man's boner.,Client,joy,undefined
They call it angel lust.,Client,joy,undefined
"Anyway, so i'm lying there and i'm thinking about that story.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I know what's happening to me and I said to myself,",Client,neutral,undefined
"God almighty, just...",Client,fear,undefined
"don't let me have an erection right now,",Client,fear,undefined
not a hard-O.,Client,fear,undefined
"Because if you had an erection, it would mean that...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That would mean that I was dead.,Client,fear,undefined
And your friend daniel was with you throughout this?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, resuscitation, CPR...",Client,fear,undefined
"Daniel's a doctor, i forgot to say that.",Client,fear,undefined
"For a minute, I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"your friend, Daniel.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Excuse me?,Client,joy,undefined
Don't you think you're exaggerating? I explained something simple...,Client,joy,undefined
A dead man's erection. What's that gotta do with daniel?,Client,joy,undefined
Maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on When I was talking about,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the customer always being wrong.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What I meant was that sometimes,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the patient hides things from his therapist...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
From himself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And so part of our job is to uncover,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
the things that we hide.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
So my secret is i'm afraid of homosexuals?,Client,joy,undefined
"No, not necessarily.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I just wand to clarify that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Okay. That's neither here nor there.,Client,joy,undefined
I wanna get to my point.,Client,joy,undefined
Go ahead.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I didn't have the erection so you can relax.,Client,joy,undefined
But I tell you I remember,Client,fear,undefined
very vividly that moment just before passing out...,Client,fear,undefined
Before losing consciousness.,Client,fear,undefined
Losing consciousns... That's a funny expression.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why do you think that's a funny expression?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Losing consciousness... It's an expression my father would use...,Client,disgust,undefined
Everything in terms of profits and loss.,Client,disgust,undefined
Fits him like a glove.,Client,disgust,undefined
So something about,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
how you describe your last moments is equated with your father,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
seeing things in terms of profit and loss?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Is that...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Okay, with all due respect,",Client,anger,undefined
I think we've come to this way too early.,Client,anger,undefined
"All this stuff about the father son relationship,",Client,anger,undefined
I don't think it should come up so soon.,Client,anger,undefined
You think it's too soon?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, forget what I feel.",Client,anger,undefined
I know it's too soon.,Client,anger,undefined
I wanna know what you think.,Client,depression,undefined
So you're...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You're testing me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm entitled to some testing.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm paying for it.,Client,neutral,undefined
Actually I think you've been testing me since you walked through the door.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You've asked about me and my reputation.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You ask-- Well you practically demand that I ask you certain questions,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that you think i'm dying to ask.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"It's really important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that you set before you walked through the door.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What's wrong with that?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, I did my research.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's a one-and-a-half-Hour drive to get here and i'm paying you good money.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And i'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger,",Client,neutral,undefined
the most intimate things about my life.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Plus, there are risks here.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal For spilling my guts in here.,Client,neutral,undefined
i'm not gonna open up to you just like that without knowing what you are.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And what do you expect to find, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
How are we going to know,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that i'm a good enough therapist for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'll know...,Client,neutral,undefined
According to your opinion.,Client,neutral,undefined
My opinion of what?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Of the issue i came here to talk about.,Client,neutral,undefined
But i'll come to that in a minute.,Client,neutral,undefined
It has to do with what happened to me after taking me out of the freezer.,Client,depression,undefined
the freezer?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Oh, you mean that you were grounded?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, literally frozen.",Client,depression,undefined
They froze me.,Client,depression,undefined
The mobile intensive care unit arrived and they put me in a suit,Client,depression,undefined
that freezes you.,Client,depression,undefined
"They've got one out of presbyterian, which is...",Client,depression,undefined
no more than 3/4 of a mile from where I collapsed,Client,depression,undefined
and their e.R. Is tops.,Client,depression,undefined
Let's go back to this--,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Yeah, we're getting there. You have no patience.",Client,anger,undefined
I was told you were a good listener.,Client,anger,undefined
Now look...,Client,depression,undefined
It works on a very simple principle.,Client,depression,undefined
It reduces the shock to the body's systems,Client,depression,undefined
by dropping the body temperature.,Client,depression,undefined
Oh. So how long were you--,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"In my case, 48 hours. It's a record.",Client,joy,undefined
There's no history of anyone who's been in that suit,Client,joy,undefined
for such a long period of time.,Client,joy,undefined
I guess I went a long way up that tunnel?,Client,joy,undefined
The tunnel that wasn't there.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, unfortunately not.",Client,depression,undefined
So tell me what you remember,Therapist,neutral,Open question
about this 48 hours.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Mostly I remember...,Client,neutral,undefined
A terrible fatigue.,Client,neutral,undefined
I guess that's why they call it dead tired.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's physical but mainly mental--,Client,neutral,undefined
Exhaustion.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I remember very clearly,Client,depression,undefined
the relief I felt...,Client,depression,undefined
when I succeeded in coming back over into the world.,Client,depression,undefined
You say that you succeeded,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
in coming back to this world.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Did you fe it was under your control?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What are you trying to get at?,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not trying to get at anything.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But what you're describing is a strong will to live.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I mean, during this experience, there was a decision to go on living.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, I guess you're right",Client,depression,undefined
"Yet,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
despite having made this effort to live...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Everybody's disappointed.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Listen, it's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's a one-in-a-million thing.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And if you don't supply the goods, then...",Client,neutral,undefined
"Listen, I have never...",Client,neutral,undefined
spent a day in my life in a hospital.,Client,neutral,undefined
You get it?,Client,neutral,undefined
Never.,Client,neutral,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
perhaps your anger isn't directed at the people,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
who were interested in the tunnel.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"but you're angry at yourself, Alex-.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How your body betrayed you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I mean, this is a systems failure",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I have a brother who's not too bright. He's a real estate agent.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Whatever. Anyway, he's a great athlete.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And he once proved to me... And he does his research, believe me.",Client,neutral,undefined
That all the great quarterbacks in the history of football,Client,joy,undefined
were also the best-looking.,Client,joy,undefined
"Namath, Staubach, Cunningham... They're all really good-looking people.",Client,joy,undefined
The best-Looking students in the class are often great athletes.,Client,joy,undefined
You know why that is?,Client,joy,undefined
I have no idea.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"It's got nothing to do with sports, really.",Client,joy,undefined
"When they got their gift from god, the father,",Client,joy,undefined
or whoever the hell doles out the talent they got the whole package...,Client,joy,undefined
"Beauty,",Client,joy,undefined
"talent, character.",Client,joy,undefined
That's how it is. It's an evolutionary thing.,Client,joy,undefined
"So, how's your football?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Football's not my game.,Client,joy,undefined
"Running, of course,",Client,joy,undefined
"Wrestling, pole vault once upon a time.",Client,joy,undefined
But now I am part of a military elite.,Client,joy,undefined
Athletes may be popular but we are the <i>crème de la crème</i>.,Client,joy,undefined
You have to understand that you're talking to a person here,Client,joy,undefined
whose whole life was perfect.,Client,joy,undefined
"People in my line of work are born to excel, to be perfect.",Client,joy,undefined
It wasn't our choice.,Client,joy,undefined
It was life that chose us to be the best.,Client,joy,undefined
"And what does that mean, life chose us?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, you don't become a fighter pilot suddenly at age 20.",Client,joy,undefined
"At age seven or eight when you're in the third grade,",Client,joy,undefined
you know you're talented.,Client,joy,undefined
You know you're headed somewhere special.,Client,joy,undefined
You are going to be the best.,Client,joy,undefined
And it all lays out right in front of you...,Client,joy,undefined
"Top grades, varsity letters, you name it.",Client,joy,undefined
"I'm a topgun grad, you understand that?",Client,joy,undefined
That training is not for pussies.,Client,joy,undefined
"So, if you don't achieve your personal best...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Are you disappointed in yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, no, that's not...",Client,neutral,undefined
How much longer do we have?,Client,neutral,undefined
We've got time.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I'll tell you when it's time.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Okay, so here's my point... Finally.",Client,neutral,undefined
I came here to get your advice on something.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I decided to go there... To the target.,Client,neutral,undefined
You understand what i'm talking about here?,Client,neutral,undefined
You mean to the site where you dropped the bomb?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
To the school?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Madrasa.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wanna go back and take a look around.,Client,neutral,undefined
To the place where the children were killed?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Correct. I know what you're thinking so let me straighten this out for you.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't have a guilty conscience. I already told you that.,Client,neutral,undefined
I sleep well at night. Very well.,Client,neutral,undefined
why would you want to go back?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm interested.,Client,neutral,undefined
"From the moment I came out of that freezer, I knew I wanted to go back.",Client,neutral,undefined
And it came up in a conversationi had with daniel,Client,neutral,undefined
when he came to visit me at the hospital.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He thinks, who knows,",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm gonna freak out or something. He thinks it's a crazy thing to do.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he said I need to see someone first.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Psychologist, psychiatrist.",Client,neutral,undefined
Don't you think it's dangerous?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Not at all.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't really think anyone will recognize me.,Client,neutral,undefined
But your picture's on the internet.,Client,neutral,undefined
No way. You saw the picture.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's totally ridiculous. My mother wouldn't recognize me from that picture.,Client,neutral,undefined
Not even michaela.,Client,neutral,undefined
Who's michaela?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
My wife.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what does she think of all this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What's she got to do with it?,Client,neutral,undefined
Don't you talk things over with your wife?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You know what? This is not for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"All this what do you feel, what do you think?",Client,neutral,undefined
I asked you something. I came to you to consult,Client,anger,undefined
about something very clear and specific.,Client,anger,undefined
So you want me to tell you that this desire of yours,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to go back to where the bombing took place...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
is a good thing?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Okay, yeah, yes.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you want me to take responsibility for this visit?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Okay, do me a favor, don't make me into an idiot.",Client,anger,undefined
"What, I'm not taking responsibility?",Client,anger,undefined
"No, i'm just going back to something that you said earlier on.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Remember you said that life chose you,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to be a member of an elite? That it wasn't your decision?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Maybe that's an attitude you're comfortable with.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're comfortable with it because you don't have to make any decisions.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It relieves you of responsibility.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Your commanding officer, he makes the decisions,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"conveys them to you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and you execute them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Wait, are you trying to tell me that i'm asking you",Client,joy,undefined
to be my commanding officer?,Client,joy,undefined
"Okay, i'll buy it.",Client,joy,undefined
"So, are you willing to...",Client,joy,undefined
To be my CO?,Client,joy,undefined
For $150 an hour?,Client,joy,undefined

Are you worried that i won't be available?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,depression,undefined
Are you this much of a pain in the ass,Client,anger,undefined
With your daughter?,Client,anger,undefined
"Much much worse, believe me.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"And yes, i do try to understand my daughter,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
If that's what you're asking.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That's not what i'm asking.,Client,depression,undefined
Let's say she wants to talk to you now.,Client,depression,undefined
What'll she do?,Client,depression,undefined
I don't think she'll wait till 10 to,Client,disgust,undefined
So she can talk to you.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Who do you call, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, suddenly you don't feel comfortable",Client,neutral,undefined
Talking about your daughter.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, she calls me at 10 minutes",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Before the hour, she leaves a message",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And i get back to her.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But who do you call?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Who do i call for what?,Client,depression,undefined
When you need to talk to someone.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
411,Client,depression,undefined
411?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah. Because my father has moved,Client,joy,undefined
"So many times in the past few years,",Client,joy,undefined
I can never remember his latest phone number.,Client,joy,undefined
It's like a family joke.,Client,joy,undefined
We call 411.,Client,joy,undefined
How do you get on with your dad?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He's always there for me.,Client,depression,undefined
What do you mean he's always there for you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He's there.,Client,depression,undefined
He knows what's happening to me.,Client,depression,undefined
"Like when i had the accident,",Client,depression,undefined
He called me when i was in the ambulance.,Client,depression,undefined
He knew something had happened.,Client,depression,undefined
That's what they told me.,Client,depression,undefined
So is it like you guys have a kind of,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Telepathy together?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He's the only person in this world,Client,neutral,undefined
Who truly loves me,Client,neutral,undefined
And the only one that believes that the accident,Client,neutral,undefined
Was not my fault.,Client,neutral,undefined
The only one except Cy.,Client,neutral,undefined
Who's Cy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
This is Cy.,Client,neutral,undefined
Cy is a mermaid?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, Cy drew it.",Client,neutral,undefined
He's my coach.,Client,joy,undefined
Dana colored it. That's his daughter.,Client,joy,undefined
I used to be her babysitter.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do i have to go now?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
So-- So you babysit for your coach?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, since before i joined his gym.",Client,neutral,undefined
"So Cy is the only one,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Apart from your dad, who",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Loves you ?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Or he's the only who,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Thinks that you didn't crash your bike,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
On purpose?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that important,Client,neutral,undefined
For your professional opinion?,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I'll tell you what i want us to do.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"I would like, before our next meeting,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
For us to do some homework.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
We both write up our opinion,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Of what's in that report. What do you say?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
How am i supposed to write like this?,Client,neutral,undefined
You can get somebody to help you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"You can do it on tape, if you'd like.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
What am i supposed to write?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Your own opinion,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Your own assessment,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Of what's in there.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
What do you say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't think so.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think you can do it.,Therapist,joy,Approval
"Hello, Gina.",Client,joy,undefined
"Hello, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I, um...",Client,joy,undefined
I couldn't remember which entrance to use.,Client,joy,undefined
"I was parking the car and I thought,",Client,joy,undefined
Is it the front entrance or the...,Client,joy,undefined
You haven't been here in a while.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Sure.,Client,joy,undefined
Come in.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What would you like to drink? Coffee?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No. No no, I'm fine actually.",Client,joy,undefined
That's where I sit.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yes, of course.",Client,joy,undefined
"You look very well, Gina.",Client,joy,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
It's not true but it's nice to hear.,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
"The hardest part about turning 60 is that,",Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
"in my mind, I'm still as energetic as a 30-year-old.",Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
"For six hours, I have all the energy of a 30-year-old.",Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
"The rest of the day, I'm an old, tired woman.",Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
I can't believe that.,Client,joy,undefined
Would you like a piece of cake?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's sugar-free though. Doctor's orders.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Don't get me started.,Client,joy,undefined
I can't eat anything that I like these days.,Client,joy,undefined
Cholesterol.,Client,joy,undefined
"You know, it's, um...",Client,joy,undefined
It's kind of funny being here again.,Client,joy,undefined
"Well, I'm retired now",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
so I turned this room into a study.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, so I see.",Client,joy,undefined
It's where I do my writing.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're writing.,Client,joy,undefined
But what?,Client,joy,undefined
I don't know.,Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
Maybe an article or something less formal.,Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
Maybe something longer.,Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's strange...,Client,joy,undefined
being here after David.,Client,joy,undefined
How are you coping with that?,Client,joy,undefined
"It was probably the most difficult time of my life,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
coming back home without him.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
He was a remarkable man.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, he was.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How about you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, me.",Client,joy,undefined
"Well, I'm, um...",Client,joy,undefined
I'm working too hard.,Client,joy,undefined
I'm trying to lose this weight. I can't.,Client,neutral,undefined
I feel like I'm having another midlife crisis.,Client,joy,undefined
"Had one at 30,",Client,joy,undefined
another one at 40 and now I'm having my third one at 50.,Client,joy,undefined
How's Kate?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Kate's good. She's fine.,Client,joy,undefined
And the kids?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"The kids, well...",Client,neutral,undefined
Ian's gone to college. He's at Wesleyan.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Rosie, well, she's busy being Rosie.",Client,neutral,undefined
Rosie. How old is she now?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
17,Client,neutral,undefined
She's still exactly the same.,Client,joy,undefined
She's still got the world wrapped around her little finger.,Client,joy,undefined
17,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And, of course, Max.",Client,joy,undefined
Max is nine.,Client,joy,undefined
Max?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Kate got pregnant after we'd last seen each other.,Client,joy,undefined
And so we had Max...,Client,joy,undefined
"Everybody's favorite,",Client,joy,undefined
like Joseph and his brothers.,Client,joy,undefined
So he's exactly the age Rosie was when you...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yes, when I stopped coming here, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Gina, I...",Client,depression,undefined
"I called you last night because, um...",Client,depression,undefined
I really felt that I needed to talk to somebody.,Client,depression,undefined
"It's, um...",Client,depression,undefined
"Actually, it's something that's been bothering me a lot",Client,depression,undefined
lately but,Client,depression,undefined
only yesterday I really felt the need that I had to...,Client,depression,undefined
to talk about it.,Client,depression,undefined
I feel that...,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't know how to put this but I feel like I'm...,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm just losing my patience.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm losing my patience with my patients.,Client,disgust,undefined
There are sessions when I can barely restrain myself,Client,disgust,undefined
from having just...,Client,disgust,undefined
from an outburst.,Client,disgust,undefined
I want to just lock the door some days,Client,disgust,undefined
and wish everybody would just go away.,Client,disgust,undefined
I have this...,Client,depression,undefined
I have this couple who've been coming to me,Client,depression,undefined
for marriage counseling.,Client,depression,undefined
They have one child,Client,depression,undefined
but they have been trying for five years to have another baby.,Client,depression,undefined
So she gets pregnant,Client,depression,undefined
and now she wants to have an abortion.,Client,depression,undefined
I think what she really wants,Client,depression,undefined
is to get rid of the husband if you ask me.,Client,depression,undefined
"But anyway, this guy...",Client,anger,undefined
really got on my nerves yesterday.,Client,anger,undefined
He cornered me.,Client,anger,undefined
He badgered me until I made a decision.,Client,anger,undefined
Should we have an abortion? Should we not have an abortion?,Client,anger,undefined
"I finally said, Yes, good, have an abortion.",Client,anger,undefined
As soon as I said it of course,Client,disgust,undefined
I regretted it because I knew that I had spoken in anger but I...,Client,disgust,undefined
"I couldn't help it. This guy, he just...",Client,disgust,undefined
he said some really nasty things to me.,Client,disgust,undefined
He called me...,Client,anger,undefined
a murderer.,Client,anger,undefined
I knew he was right the second it came out of my mouth.,Client,anger,undefined
Of course he was right. I was sitting there telling him,Client,anger,undefined
to kill his baby.,Client,anger,undefined
"But still, I was...",Client,anger,undefined
I know I'm not making much sense but...,Client,anger,undefined
anyway.,Client,anger,undefined
And there's this girl,Client,disgust,undefined
who I've been working with for a year.,Client,disgust,undefined
There's an issue of erotic transference,Client,disgust,undefined
and this came out now.,Client,disgust,undefined
Everything is all about this issue,Client,disgust,undefined
"and I'm thinking to myself, What...",Client,disgust,undefined
"If patients could see what I think about them,",Client,disgust,undefined
"if they could really see inside my head,",Client,disgust,undefined
"they'd head for the hills, believe me.",Client,disgust,undefined
They'd run for cover.,Client,disgust,undefined
What about new patients? Are you taking on new patients?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, I am. I think I take them on",Client,neutral,undefined
to prove to myself that everything is okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I've taken on this guy,",Client,neutral,undefined
he's a bomber pilot.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Cocky,",Client,neutral,undefined
"arrogant kind of a guy. Macho, you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Flew a mission over Iraq,",Client,neutral,undefined
dropped a bomb,Client,neutral,undefined
on a school where 16 children were killed.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So he comes back, he goes on leave",Client,depression,undefined
and then he runs for 22 miles without stopping,Client,depression,undefined
and brings a heart attack on to himself.,Client,depression,undefined
So I'm trying to get this guy to see that,Client,depression,undefined
maybe there's a connection between these two events but...,Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, all the time I listen, you know,",Client,depression,undefined
as if it's nothing.,Client,depression,undefined
"But inside, I'm just...",Client,disgust,undefined
I just find it so...,Client,disgust,undefined
so disgusting.,Client,disgust,undefined
And there's a girl who goes to Rosie's school,Client,neutral,undefined
who...,Client,neutral,undefined
You're treating a friend of your daughter's?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, she's not a friend. They're just in the same grade.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, this girl...",Client,neutral,undefined
idolizes her coach.,Client,neutral,undefined
Were you insulted?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
About what?,Client,neutral,undefined
That the patient called you a murderer?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yes, I was.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Gina, I know I'm a good therapist.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know, maybe this week",Client,depression,undefined
"I need somebody to just tell me to calm down,",Client,depression,undefined
"tell me that everything's okay, that everything's all right.",Client,depression,undefined
I remember you said once that one of our biggest problems,Client,depression,undefined
was that we don't have an audience.,Client,depression,undefined
"We don't have anybody to pat us on the back,",Client,depression,undefined
to approve of what we're doing.,Client,depression,undefined
"Somebody that you can go to and say,",Client,depression,undefined
Did you see how I maneuvered that person into that situation?,Client,depression,undefined
Did you see how I got him to say what I wanted him to?,Client,depression,undefined
"What I meant was,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"is that we have no one to criticize us, no one to review us.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Anyway, I...",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm beginning to feel anxious before sessions and I...,Client,neutral,undefined
I must admit that I thought something was going on,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
at home when you called.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
At home? Why?,Client,depression,undefined
Because it's been almost 10 years,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
since I last heard from you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"The last time you were here, you were so angry.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You didn't even come to the funeral.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I thought,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
How angry he must be.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
He didn't even come to David's funeral.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"And I'm really sorry about that, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
I had...,Client,neutral,undefined
I was gonna come but I felt that it was...,Client,neutral,undefined
I felt it was inappropriate.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then you call me out of the blue.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yes, because I needed somebody to talk to.",Client,neutral,undefined
You were the one who chose to stop having a supervisor.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You said...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I interfered with your practice,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that instead of guiding I was interfering.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yes, I said that.",Client,neutral,undefined
But then there are times,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
when a supervisor has to take a stand.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
In your case I felt I had to take a stand.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I had to interfere.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But that's not the way I feel now.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, that's ancient history. Why do we have to go there?",Client,anger,undefined
"Anyway, whatever happened,",Client,neutral,undefined
I always felt that,Client,neutral,undefined
you were somebody professionally I could...,Client,neutral,undefined
I could at least talk to.,Client,neutral,undefined
Me? I'm already retired.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Oh, I forgot, yes.",Client,joy,undefined
You're writing your memoires.,Client,joy,undefined
No. No no no.,Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
I thought that's what you meant,Client,neutral,undefined
when you said that you were writing.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Why, are you afraid I'll write about you?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think there's way too many autobiographies anyway.,Client,neutral,undefined
Who cares?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Maybe somebody like Bob Dylan,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'd be curious about that, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
How many people like him are out there?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm trying to write a novel.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Oh yeah?,Client,joy,undefined
"Wow, that's...",Client,joy,undefined
"I don't know, we'll see.",Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
I've given myself a year to write.,Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
I don't know what else to say about it right now.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Kate and I,",Client,anger,undefined
we...,Client,anger,undefined
we just argue nonstop.,Client,anger,undefined
I think it's beginning to affect my work.,Client,anger,undefined
What do you mean you argue?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, it's always about something insignificant,",Client,disgust,undefined
something trivial that triggers it off.,Client,disgust,undefined
This time it was about Max,Client,disgust,undefined
and being asked to go to these classes,Client,disgust,undefined
"for gifted children, which I just...",Client,disgust,undefined
Is Max gifted?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"He's very very smart, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well then, what do you fight about?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
She knows how I feel about this.,Client,anger,undefined
I have said it over and over again.,Client,anger,undefined
I am against the idea of it. What does she do?,Client,anger,undefined
"Behind my back, she takes Max to this...",Client,anger,undefined
to this class without telling me.,Client,anger,undefined
"And, you know, they decide that...",Client,anger,undefined
Who are they?,Client,anger,undefined
This principal and... and Kate.,Client,neutral,undefined
"This girl... she's barely out of college,",Client,neutral,undefined
she barely knows my son's name...,Client,anger,undefined
"Pontificating, telling me how I should raise my kid.",Client,anger,undefined
And Kate and I start to argue about...,Client,anger,undefined
about that and then that leads onto,Client,anger,undefined
"other stuff and then we end up and it's like,",Client,anger,undefined
"Oh, you care so much about your patients.",Client,anger,undefined
If you cared as much about your family,Client,anger,undefined
"as you cared about your patients, then it would...",Client,anger,undefined
Kate said that?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
She says I don't love her...,Client,depression,undefined
"That I'm always trying to be a step ahead of her,",Client,depression,undefined
that I handle her like a patient.,Client,depression,undefined
She says the thing that she hates the most,Client,depression,undefined
is that I see it all from a distance.,Client,depression,undefined
"What do you mean, it?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Her, us, it.",Client,depression,undefined
"She says that when it comes to us,",Client,depression,undefined
I'll never have any perspective.,Client,depression,undefined
"She's right, isn't she?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But I can't help but see it from a perspective.,Client,neutral,undefined
And all I can see is...,Client,disgust,undefined
all I can see is rupture.,Client,disgust,undefined
"What do you mean, rupture?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Are you trying to shrink me, Gina?",Client,neutral,undefined
Sorry.,Therapist,joy,Interpretation
And yet you were here for eight years.,Therapist,joy,Interpretation
"Yes, what does that mean?",Client,depression,undefined
You were under my counseling.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Eight years, I took care of you.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You find that difficult to accept?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I was your audience for eight years.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe I shouldn't have told you all this stuff about...,Client,neutral,undefined
About Kate.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe it's just because I'm exhausted. I am,Client,depression,undefined
wiped out.,Client,depression,undefined
And I'm just afraid that,Client,depression,undefined
"because of that, something that will happen,",Client,depression,undefined
that I'll lose control.,Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway,",Client,depression,undefined
"we didn't come here to talk about Kate... though, of course,",Client,disgust,undefined
just before I came here we had a big fight on the phone.,Client,disgust,undefined
You keep saying you didn't come here to talk about Kate,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but you keep talking about her.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's because you make me,Client,neutral,undefined
talk about her.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not doing anything.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"It's been eight years, and I'm trying to catch up.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Gina, I'm not stupid.",Client,depression,undefined
"There's always a reason with you, so don't...",Client,depression,undefined
Don't tell me we're having a nice cozy conversation here,Client,depression,undefined
about my married life.,Client,depression,undefined
What do you wanna do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We could get together a couple of times and see how it goes.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is this time good for you?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Yeah, it's fine.",Client,neutral,undefined
May I say something before we go on?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What about? Kate?,Client,neutral,undefined
There's a sadness when you talk about her...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
In your voice.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
There's something very sad about it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't know where she is most of the time.,Client,disgust,undefined
She tells me that she's going to the gym and I...,Client,disgust,undefined
I look in her closet and...,Client,disgust,undefined
her gear is still there.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And I say to myself, Oh, you know, she's...",Client,depression,undefined
she's probably got another set of running shoes.,Client,depression,undefined
"When I call her cell,",Client,depression,undefined
she never answers.,Client,depression,undefined
I let it go.,Client,depression,undefined
"Usually in the evening, we're too tired and",Client,depression,undefined
"so a week later I'll suddenly say,",Client,depression,undefined
Where were you last Wednesday?,Client,depression,undefined
And she'll look at me like I'm...,Client,depression,undefined
I'm crazy.,Client,depression,undefined
And then...,Client,disgust,undefined
Sex.,Client,disgust,undefined
Sex is out of the question.,Client,disgust,undefined
Once a month if I'm lucky.,Client,depression,undefined
She hardly ever...,Client,depression,undefined
initiates it.,Client,depression,undefined
I can't remember the last time she wanted it.,Client,depression,undefined
What about you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you want to?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think about it all the time.,Client,neutral,undefined
What would you say,Client,neutral,undefined
if somebody came to you with a story like mine?,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
We're talking about you and Kate.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
We're not speculating about a patient.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you want me to say that she's having an affair?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Because I don't know where she is,",Client,disgust,undefined
because of her running shoes?,Client,disgust,undefined
"I always ask myself,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"If they were to diagnose therapists whose marriages fell apart,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
how many cases of erotic transference would they find?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What does that mean?,Client,depression,undefined
That sometimes erotic transference in therapy,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is a test of your married life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
If a therapist can't handle a situation,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"where his patient falls in love with him,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it may indicate some breakdown in his private life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yes, but I don't think my marriage to Kate is falling apart.",Client,anger,undefined
"Yes, I had a row with Laura...",Client,anger,undefined
I mean with Kate.,Client,anger,undefined
Whose Laura? Rosie's friend?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The girl with the issue of,Client,depression,undefined
of erotic transference.,Client,depression,undefined
You didn't mention her by name.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You just said it had come up.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
She told me that...,Client,neutral,undefined
She told me that she's in love with me,Client,neutral,undefined
and that she wants to sleep with me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Okay, what?",Client,depression,undefined
Are you saying that Kate felt that,Client,depression,undefined
and that's where our tensions come from?,Client,depression,undefined
"Good material for your novel, Gina.",Client,depression,undefined
"Come on, you know that",Client,depression,undefined
therapists get divorced like everybody else.,Client,depression,undefined
"Please don't draw any conclusions,",Client,neutral,undefined
because there are none to be drawn.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Besides, my troubles at home didn't begin last week",Client,disgust,undefined
or last month.,Client,disgust,undefined
How would you say her therapy is going?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Whose therapy?,Client,neutral,undefined
"You said, talking about your sessions, that you...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"cut things short, you have no patience,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that you often feel guilty about your behavior.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Is that true also with Linda?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Laura.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sorry, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Look, Gina, you know that",Client,neutral,undefined
patients fall for their therapists every few seconds.,Client,neutral,undefined
What better way is there to air this,Client,neutral,undefined
than to bring it to the surface and put it out there?,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, this room is supposed to be safe zone",Client,neutral,undefined
where we can open things up and talk about things in a controlled way.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Just to make things perfectly clear,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"this is transference, plain and simple.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Of course you and Mitchell and your New York gang,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
have idealized it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Gina, I didn't come here to talk about a patient.",Client,anger,undefined
I think you did come here to talk about Laura.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

About Laura? That you can avoid talking about her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know what, Gina?",Client,anger,undefined
"I think this was a mistake, coming here today.",Client,anger,undefined
I think I'd better leave.,Client,anger,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because you twist everything into your own preconceived notions...,Client,anger,undefined
Was there physical contact?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,anger,undefined
You hesitated before you answered.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Because I'm shocked at where this is going.,Client,anger,undefined
What do you think I did? Sleep with this girl,Client,anger,undefined
and then come here to confess to you?,Client,anger,undefined
When did it happen?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
When did what happen?,Client,anger,undefined
Nothing happened. I keep telling you nothing happened.,Client,anger,undefined
No. No no no.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills

"about how long it's been since I've been here, why I left,",Client,anger,undefined
"how I felt, how you felt... blah blah blah.",Client,anger,undefined
Was I that big a disappointment to you?,Client,anger,undefined
Because I didn't stay your loyal intern forever and ever?,Client,anger,undefined
I'm just trying to understand what it is,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're trying to tell me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm trying to understand what moves you're trying to make.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What moves I'm trying to make?,Client,anger,undefined

Legitimacy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Legitimacy for what?,Client,anger,undefined
How old is this girl?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She's...,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know... 30, 29.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I just wonder, when you talk about feeling guilty,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is it about your patients generally that you feel guilty?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Or is it about one patient in particular?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Oh, give me a break, Gina.",Client,anger,undefined
"God, I hope your novel doesn't sink this low.",Client,anger,undefined
What's bugging you so much?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You are.,Client,disgust,undefined
You.,Client,disgust,undefined
It's unbelievable how much you're enjoying yourself.,Client,anger,undefined
Erotic transference happens all the time.,Client,anger,undefined
It's simply a question of how one deals with it.,Client,anger,undefined
Now I know how to deal with it.,Client,anger,undefined
Can you honestly say to yourself,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that her falling in love with you,Therapist,neutral,Open question
is just a part of her healing process?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And that it has nothing to do with you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe you're a little worried,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because of your family history...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That it could go too far.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Gina...,Client,anger,undefined
"Timing, dosage, tact, you're failing in all three.",Client,anger,undefined
I'm not my father.,Client,anger,undefined
My father was a doctor.,Client,anger,undefined
He left the house of one of his patients.,Client,anger,undefined
We're talking about a girl who has a crush on her therapist.,Client,anger,undefined
It's a completely different thing and you know damn well it is.,Client,anger,undefined
You should get counseling regarding this Linda.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Laura.,Client,anger,undefined
"Sorry, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Let's not call it counseling. Let's call it talking.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Laura... Laura is her name.,Client,disgust,undefined
"God, you're so caught up in your little theories",Client,disgust,undefined
that you don't even remember her name.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why don't you ask her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Ask who?,Client,anger,undefined
Kate.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"What, if she's seeing somebody?",Client,anger,undefined
"That would make you happy, I bet.",Client,anger,undefined

Are you afraid to find out it's true?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, I am.",Client,anger,undefined
But you're convinced it's not.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Correct.,Client,anger,undefined
Why did these questions make you so angry?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'll tell you why: because you are not being helpful.,Client,anger,undefined
Helpful.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Now I'm totally confused.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

to ask for my guidance?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Or to talk to me as a friend?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Are you seeking advice from a colleague?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What role have you assigned me?,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
I'm trying to figure it out but I'm failing!,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
"Listen, Paul...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"It's not easy for me either,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
seeing you after all this time.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You walked through that door after everything that happened,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
as though it was nothing.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It was confusing.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I couldn't think of anybody else,Client,depression,undefined
to talk to.,Client,depression,undefined
You know what bothers me?,Client,depression,undefined
"When I walked through the door,",Client,depression,undefined
I felt that you looked at me with glee.,Client,depression,undefined

waiting for something like this to happen.,Client,disgust,undefined
Look at you. You've woken up.,Client,anger,undefined
You're full of life.,Client,anger,undefined
"If that's the way you feel, maybe we shouldn't meet.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea after all.,Client,neutral,undefined
You should get...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
professional help regarding this Laura.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't need it.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think you do.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"In any case, if you feel like talking, call me.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I wouldn't be waiting on the end of a telephone if I was you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why do these questions make you so angry?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm not angry. I'm really not.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why are you running away?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I'm not running away, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
Give my best to Kate.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills

Talk to her about it. It'll make things easier for you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Good night, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined

To Andrew.,Client,joy,undefined
We already set a date. It's gonna be the third weekend in June.,Client,joy,undefined
"You know, everybody gets married in June.",Client,joy,undefined
So.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So you'll be a,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
summer bride.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Evidently so.,Client,joy,undefined

Andrew and I wanted to invite you.,Client,joy,undefined
Your wife too.,Client,joy,undefined
"But you wouldn't come, right? Would you? No, of course you wouldn't.",Client,joy,undefined
But we did actually talk about it yesterday. Right after,Client,joy,undefined
I said yes we started making a guest list and,Client,joy,undefined
for a few minutes there you were on it.,Client,joy,undefined
"Wait a minute, you said yes",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
just yesterday?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
I couldn't make up my mind.,Client,neutral,undefined
It took me a few days to get over the other night and our session.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wanted to calm down first.,Client,neutral,undefined
Andrew was cool with that. He said,Client,neutral,undefined
a day here or there wouldn't matter as long as I was moving toward a decision.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, he's very happy that you're helping me.",Client,joy,undefined
For a while there he thought he'd made a mistake,Client,joy,undefined
recommending that I come see you. He said that.,Client,joy,undefined
But he think you're an amazing therapist,Client,joy,undefined
and that his instincts were just right,Client,joy,undefined
and that you're on our side.,Client,joy,undefined
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
I guess I'm.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm just trying to get used to,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

You say that like you're not so sure.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, I'm sure.",Client,neutral,undefined

right now it just seems like you're trying to be a bit of a...,Client,neutral,undefined
Killjoy?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Killjoy, yes, something like that. So don't.",Client,neutral,undefined
Especially since Joy is a very rare thing when it comes to me.,Client,neutral,undefined

if you haven't perhaps taken a shortcut.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You think that i'm faking this?,Client,anger,undefined
That I'm actually totally depressed?,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, maybe it's you that's faking it?",Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, that congratulations was a bit labored, don't you think?",Client,anger,undefined
I. I don't know if you ow anything about,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

Anyway it. It seems like there's.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
There's a huge gap between,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the depths,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you reached last week and the,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
heights,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
at which you are today. I'm just trying to,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

Where'd you go?,Client,joy,undefined
Mexico?,Client,joy,undefined
The Caribbean?,Client,joy,undefined
Are you interested in,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Scuba diving?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

Sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"No, seriously, I dov a lot before I met Andrew.",Client,neutral,undefined
He.,Client,neutral,undefined
He hates it. It's claustrophobic.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's nice to find we have something in common, you and me.",Client,joy,undefined
Isn't it?,Client,joy,undefined
"Where are you now, Laura?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I just had a scary thought. I just,Client,neutral,undefined
"I know it's Silly, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
Beforehand when you said your,Client,depression,undefined
"Your lungs could explode,",Client,depression,undefined
"I don't know, it's just the thought that something might happen to you.",Client,depression,undefined
Yet you're the one who ascended so fast.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You know what, Paul? I don't want a depressing session.",Client,depression,undefined
"I want a happy session. I came with good news, so show a little support.",Client,depression,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Okay, yesterday I was at Natalie's.",Client,depression,undefined
"You know, Andrew's ex.",Client,depression,undefined
"And Gary the husband, the ones who had a baby a few months ago.",Client,depression,undefined
"And they keep calling, you know, to invite us over and I keep avoiding them.",Client,neutral,undefined
"But yesterday when they called to invite us over for brunch,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, anyway, Gary Makesdim sum.",Client,joy,undefined
"I swear, Paul, he has those Bamboo Steamers and everything.",Client,joy,undefined
"So I said to Andrew, okay, let's go.",Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, he's being so sweet to me all week,",Client,joy,undefined
I thought this is the least I could do.,Client,joy,undefined
"So his agreeing to postpone the ultimatum, that",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
dis. Disarmed you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
All right. Go ahead.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"They have a baby,",Client,joy,undefined
"these Huge eyes. I mean, the baby is.",Client,joy,undefined
The baby's all eyes. So beautiful.,Client,joy,undefined
And the way he breastfeeds.,Client,joy,undefined
All morning he was attached to Natalie's nipple.,Client,joy,undefined
"This, this Huge dark nipple.",Client,joy,undefined
I've never seen anything like it in my life.,Client,joy,undefined
And at one point she took her boob out of the baby's mouth,Client,joy,undefined
and squeezed it and some milk,Client,joy,undefined
squirted out.,Client,joy,undefined
Ani look over at Andrew and he has this admiring smile on his face.,Client,joy,undefined
"You know, like he was",Client,neutral,undefined
"loing at some masterpiece in a Museum,",Client,neutral,undefined
like the Madonna.,Client,neutral,undefined
What do you think he saw?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Maybe an image of you and he together in the future, maybe?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Or maybe he just misses her tits.,Client,joy,undefined
"No, not really. They're not that nice.",Client,joy,undefined
She's changed a lot since she had the baby.,Client,depression,undefined
In what way?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know. I didn't really know her before, but",Client,depression,undefined
Andrew told me a lot about her.,Client,depression,undefined
"He said she was this wild type, you know,",Client,depression,undefined
who had a lot of guys chasing her.,Client,depression,undefined
She put him through hell.,Client,depression,undefined
He said they'd go to bed and she'd be one person and then,Client,depression,undefined
they'd wake up and she'd be someone totally new.,Client,depression,undefined
"A free radical, that's what he used to call her.",Client,disgust,undefined
He says I remind him of her.,Client,disgust,undefined
That's scary.,Client,fear,undefined
Like this is what's left of her.,Client,fear,undefined
The front of her t-shirt soaking wet,Client,fear,undefined
"and nipples, nipples. That's all that's left.",Client,fear,undefined
She's like a wild animal that's somehow been.,Client,fear,undefined
"Shit, what's the word?",Client,fear,undefined
Domesticated?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, domesticated.",Client,fear,undefined
She looked domesticated. Housebroken.,Client,fear,undefined
She said her wildest sexual fantasy was to sleep four hours straight.,Client,fear,undefined
Does that scare you a little?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Oh my god.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'd die if I turned into a Lousy Lay.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, someone who gets fucked in her sleep and can't even remember.",Client,disgust,undefined
Do you think that's what happens to people after they get married?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't now. Does it?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Is sex something you forget how to do, or is it like riding a bike?",Client,neutral,undefined
I think that depends on the.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Okay.,Client,joy,undefined
"So anyway, when I go to the kitchen to help out with something.",Client,depression,undefined
And when I come back Andrew and Gary are engrossed,Client,depression,undefined
in this deep conversation about you won't believe this upholsterers.,Client,depression,undefined
There's this upholsterer who redid their entire living room.,Client,depression,undefined
"Andrew's taking down the guy's number and I'm like, what are you doing?",Client,depression,undefined
"And he said, you know, you and I discussed, you know recovering",Client,depression,undefined
those armchairs your dad gave you.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm telling you Paul, we never discussed this.",Client,depression,undefined
And all of a sudden Andrew's reupholstering armchairs?,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, we're talking metrosexual.",Client,depression,undefined
That doesn't sound very much like the Andrew that you've been talking about.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Exactly.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, this was beyond metrosexual.",Client,joy,undefined
Do you ever watch <i>The Animal Planet</i>?,Client,neutral,undefined
Well it was about this type of bird.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I can't remember the name of it, but anyway,",Client,neutral,undefined
the male bird builds a nest for the female...,Client,neutral,undefined
These amazingly...,Client,neutral,undefined
intricate structures. They're incredible.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, the female goes from nest to nest,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, checking out all her various mating options,",Client,neutral,undefined

Anyway...,Client,depression,undefined

Do you want to go to the movies or stay home?,Client,depression,undefined
And I said...,Client,depression,undefined

for that past few weeks has actually been one big no?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Meaning what? You think Andrew took me there as some sort of object lesson?,Client,neutral,undefined
To show me how good it could be for us? 'Cause I don't think so.,Client,neutral,undefined
Andrew's a pretty mediocre psychologist.,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you listen to me.,Client,disgust,undefined
I just said yes and I'm already bad-mouthing my future husband.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You didn't answer my question, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Where did this yes come from?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You really don't understand why I said yes to him?,Client,depression,undefined
It was because you said no to me.,Client,depression,undefined
Because...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

"that you are... Let's say,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in love with me?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"First of all, take the quotation marks off the in love with me.",Client,anger,undefined
It's insulting.,Client,anger,undefined
"And stop with the fantasy talk, because fantasies are for silly little girls.",Client,anger,undefined
"You know, we're talking about reality, which is that I'm in love with you.",Client,anger,undefined
But I still...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

for a minute.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Not the fantasy of a silly little girl,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

"I mean, so?",Client,sadness,undefined
I just wanna go back to that period for a little bit if you don't mind.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

Toxic fumes. ,Client,sadness,undefined
"Toxic fumes, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement

"how unhappy he was and how much he missed your mother,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
begging you to cut your vacation short and come back home.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What's this got to do with anything?,Client,sadness,undefined
You took a liking to these people who were,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"athletic, healthy,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the exact opposite of your parents in every way.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you described David very vividly.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

"Actually, I wanted him to adopt me.",Client,depression,undefined
"She was great... Celia. But, you know, I was 15.",Client,depression,undefined
I wanted him all to myself.,Client,depression,undefined

How do you like it? I got...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Skim, whole milk.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Got some soy here...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Black.,Client,joy,undefined
I like to taste the beans.,Client,joy,undefined
I bet you need a lot of coffee to listen to the fuck-ups in here.,Client,joy,undefined
I don't drink coffee. Just tea...,Therapist,joy,Structuring the therapy
I keep it...,Therapist,joy,Structuring the therapy
I keep it for my patients.,Therapist,joy,Structuring the therapy
Blood plessure. Irregular heartbeat.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I've just... I've just never really liked the taste.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Ah, a subconscious irregular heartbeat.",Client,joy,undefined
"What, do you get checkups? EKG?",Client,neutral,undefined
Yep! Every year.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
And? How's your heart?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's perfect.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Look, Alex, I'm...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm really glad that you came back.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"To tell you the truth, I was...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I was a little worried after you left last week.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
'Cause I wanted to go back to Baghdad?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I went.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Man, Paul!",Client,neutral,undefined
"Sorry, but the one thing I don't compromise on is coffee.",Client,neutral,undefined
Is that your reaction whenever the coffee isn't perfect?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Isn't perfect?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Paul, this is like attempted murder, your coffee.",Client,neutral,undefined
But let me hear your interpretation. It's obvious you have one.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Not really, I...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I remember I used to have this patient, once, and...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"He would come here and before each session he would say, Stop.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And then he would pop a pill.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And... it was just...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
a ritual...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What are you trying to say?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I think in his particular case,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
what he wanted to show me was his distress and his...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
His pain.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I don't know, maybe with the coffee, it's...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you're just telling me that,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're only gonna come to therapy under...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"your conditions, and anything that you don't like, you're gonna...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
spit out right away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Don't you think you're being a little dramatic?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Come on, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"So, Alex. Why did you come back?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I want your advice on another little matter.,Client,depression,undefined
"Besides, you deserve to know how my trip went.",Client,depression,undefined
"Being that you helped me decide to go. For all the wrong reasons, by the way,",Client,neutral,undefined
because my visit didn't do what it was supposed to...,Client,neutral,undefined
And what was it supposed to do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Let's just cut to the chase, okay?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Saturday morning, I'm standing near the bomb site.",Client,depression,undefined
"It's like London after the Blitz. Just rubble, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
This area had been hit again and again,Client,depression,undefined
"by us, by them, by suicide bombers.",Client,depression,undefined
We hooked up with a Red Cross unit.,Client,depression,undefined
They take us to this makeshift hospital.,Client,depression,undefined
This triage unit.,Client,depression,undefined
There weren't enough doctors to treat everybody.,Client,depression,undefined
It was chaos.,Client,depression,undefined
What did you do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was just watching.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You gotta understand, in my line of work, I'm 10,",Client,neutral,undefined
"15,000 feet up in the air.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Missile locks in on a target, by radar on a screen.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't see people. I just press a button.,Client,neutral,undefined
Just it was kind of crazy to be down there all of a sudden.,Client,depression,undefined
How did that make you feel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Coming face to face with the victims?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How would it make you feel?,Client,neutral,undefined
Scared?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Guilty.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
See that would be the normal reaction.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I knew this should have been the trauma of my life, but I felt...",Client,neutral,undefined
nothing!,Client,neutral,undefined
And then I realized...,Client,depression,undefined
the system did a great job on me.,Client,depression,undefined
"What do you mean, the system?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Listen, there's people down there.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Arms and legs missing,",Client,neutral,undefined
faces blown off... It's carnage.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And the parents are walking around, they're waiting to see",Client,neutral,undefined
if their children are gonna live or die all because of what I did.,Client,depression,undefined
But what can I tell you? To me they look like...,Client,neutral,undefined
200 people standing in line at a pharmacy.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you feel any connection with them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you feel in any way...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
responsible for what they'd suffered?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"no, no, In that moment, all I cared about was whether they cheated me or not.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, the system. The people in the madrasa...",Client,disgust,undefined
it wasn't any different to seeing it on TV.,Client,disgust,undefined
The only thing on my mind in that moment was whether,Client,depression,undefined
"the system knew that the buildings near the target's bunker,",Client,depression,undefined
the one that was supposed to get my one ton bomb...,Client,depression,undefined
If they knew these buildings were full of children...,Client,depression,undefined
"Or not, as they claim.",Client,depression,undefined
Nothing else mattered.,Client,neutral,undefined
So it was really important for you,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to know that you had done the right thing.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Like you said last week, if you hit the target, you sleep well.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And all those people whose...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
suffering you were responsible for...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Could you not see them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I saw them.",Client,neutral,undefined
I felt nothing for them.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then I realized how ingenious that my body,Client,neutral,undefined
has a built-in separation mechanism.,Client,neutral,undefined
What does that mean separation?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Compartmentalization.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm standing there and all I cared about was whether I made a precise hit.,Client,neutral,undefined
The enemy is a formula...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Size of building, amount of people, multiplied by",Client,neutral,undefined
the amount of explosive divided by 100 equals a number of estimated casualties.,Client,neutral,undefined
You understand? I'm standing there and I don't feel anything.,Client,disgust,undefined
I had this friend who died.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Four months ago.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Anyway, I...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I went to the funeral, and...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"All throughout the service I kept saying to myself, Why don't I feel sad?",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I though to myself: Maybe I didn't love him,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Maybe I didn't care.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I tormented myself for about a week.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Anyway, finally...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I realized that actually I felt,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
a great deal.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
Even the fact that I was so busy with my,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
guilty feelings...,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
Even that attests to how much I felt about him.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, but what are you saying? That I was feeling...",Client,depression,undefined
But I didn't feel what I was felling?,Client,depression,undefined
I think...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"that you have very, very...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
deep feeling about these people.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But something strong inside you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
prevents you from acknowledging those feelings.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Not just to me or to anybody else.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But to yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't understand what you're saying.,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't get what you're telling me.,Client,disgust,undefined
Feelings are not a philosophy.,Client,disgust,undefined
You either feel or you don't. You can't bullshit about it.,Client,disgust,undefined
You think I'm bullshitting?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Listen, I'm paying you",Client,anger,undefined
150 bucks for less than an hour and I don't see you making an effort.,Client,anger,undefined
150 bucks for less than an hour and I don't see you making an effort.,Client,anger,undefined
You're supposed to be smarter than me and I'm not feeling that.,Client,anger,undefined
So we're competing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
To see who's is the...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Who's the smartest.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know, Alex, I think that",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"here like everywhere else,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"like with the coffee for instance,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're concerned with what's the best.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It must be... It must be difficult.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Come on, give me a break.",Client,depression,undefined
It must be kind of frightening for you to feel...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
empathy with these people.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So you create this kind of ultimate,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"reality for yourself with those people where,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Oh no, they were just waiting in line at the pharmacy.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm just the accidental tourist.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Not the pilot who bombed them. Who killed their family.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I wish you were right.,Client,joy,undefined
But it's much more fundamental.,Client,neutral,undefined
If you hold on to this organ...,Client,depression,undefined
called guilt feelings...,Client,depression,undefined
And I believe that's what it is. It's an organ.,Client,depression,undefined
Like the spleen or liver.,Client,depression,undefined
The system will cut it out of you completely.,Client,disgust,undefined
Understand? I have no way of feelling guilt anymore.,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't have the organ.,Client,disgust,undefined
So you really believe it's possible to...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
amputate such an organ?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You went back to Iraq.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Why was it so important for you to go back?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
To risk your life just to...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Just to be there.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I told you I wanted to check if anything was left.,Client,neutral,undefined
And...,Client,neutral,undefined
And I wanted to see what happens when I come down from that top view.,Client,neutral,undefined
But nothing happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That's right, nothing.",Client,neutral,undefined
Can we...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Can we go back for a moment to the site of the bombing?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Can you describe one moment when you said to yourself,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"I should be feeling something now, right now.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
And I don't.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
There was a moment. I don't know if it's what you're looking for.,Client,depression,undefined
But there was a moment when this old man came over to me...,Client,depression,undefined
He had been burned.,Client,depression,undefined
His arm was bandaged.,Client,depression,undefined
He kept looking at me with a strange little smile.,Client,disgust,undefined
Which means I know you.,Client,disgust,undefined
I know you.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I ignored him at first, but a few minutes later he was back.",Client,depression,undefined
"I know you, I know you, he kept saying.",Client,disgust,undefined
"For a second I thought he recognized me, but I didn't really believe that.",Client,disgust,undefined
I doubt he'd ever seen the internet but...,Client,depression,undefined
In some deep intuitive way...,Client,depression,undefined
He knew.,Client,depression,undefined
He knew I was the man who dropped the bomb,Client,disgust,undefined
that destroyed the whole street we were standing on.,Client,disgust,undefined
um...ha,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You could be...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You could be describing a mystical experience,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
like a dream.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, it was like a dream, like a totally bizarre dream.",Client,depression,undefined
He started looking like some old warlock out of a fairy tale or something.,Client,fear,undefined
He wouldn't leave me alone. He kept pointing at me.,Client,fear,undefined
I know you.,Client,fear,undefined
And I looked in his eyes.,Client,fear,undefined
"And he was sort of amused, kind of friendly.",Client,fear,undefined
Like my father looks at me when he thinks I've done something wrong.,Client,fear,undefined
"Like he knows my secrets. Like no matter what I do, I can't hide from it.",Client,fear,undefined
And I was frozen there.,Client,fear,undefined
And by that time people had gathered and they were watching us.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Finally someone from the church group came and pulled me away,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but that old man, he never took his eyes off me.",Client,neutral,undefined
You still think it's too early to talk about your father?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Why, because he popped into my head for a second?",Client,neutral,undefined
You people. What is it with you people?,Client,joy,undefined
I give you a little crumb and you lunge at it.,Client,joy,undefined
"I'm just asking myself, alex, what was it about that old man that",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
makes you think about your father?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Let me tell you something:,Client,neutral,undefined
"If there's someone who does not know the meaning of guilt,",Client,neutral,undefined
it's my father.,Client,neutral,undefined
You know why?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Because if he could feel,",Client,neutral,undefined
he wouldn't have survived.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, my father killed his father",Client,disgust,undefined
with his bare hands.,Client,disgust,undefined
Yeah. And that's a fact.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Man, i'd love to see him on this couch.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Man, doc, you'd have a field day with him.",Client,neutral,undefined
You want to talk about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, now I got your attention.",Client,joy,undefined
I don't think I can tell it as well as he does. But i'll try.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Mid-'50s, right? Jim Crow Oklahoma.",Client,neutral,undefined
My old man had pissed off the local good ol'boys by trying to organize,Client,neutral,undefined
some black labor at this factory.,Client,neutral,undefined
They tried to threaten him but my dad didn't back down.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He's a tough son of a bitch, i'll give him that.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, the whole thing, it just escalated.",Client,neutral,undefined
And...,Client,neutral,undefined
this mob with hoods attacked his house.,Client,neutral,undefined
My uncle Ronnie was on the front porch with a rifle.,Client,neutral,undefined
They shot him down. Shot my aunt Jeannie too.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then they came inside.,Client,neutral,undefined
"My father takes the rest of the family, they run downstairs",Client,depression,undefined
"to the boiler room, to the basement.",Client,depression,undefined
"Right near the boiler, they all crammed into this area, this hidden room.",Client,depression,undefined
"My grandfather, his father,",Client,depression,undefined
was very sick.,Client,depression,undefined
Dying of lung cancer. And he had this...,Client,depression,undefined
Apparently he had this...,Client,depression,undefined
This wheezing and this hacking cough.,Client,depression,undefined
So my father puts his hand,Client,depression,undefined
over his father's mouth and nose and he kept it there,Client,depression,undefined
"while they searched the basement,",Client,depression,undefined
kept it clamped tight.,Client,depression,undefined
"Then when they finally cleared out,",Client,depression,undefined
my grandfather was dead.,Client,depression,undefined
He'd suffocated.,Client,depression,undefined
There it is.,Client,depression,undefined
That's...,Therapist,fear,Self-disclosure
That's a horrific story.,Therapist,fear,Self-disclosure
Tells it every year on my grandfather's birthday.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's a tradition.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you really believe he doesn't feel guilty about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I'm telling you,",Client,neutral,undefined
"he always used to say, leave the guilt for the white man.",Client,neutral,undefined
We can't afford it.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's possible that he's saying that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"it's dangerous to feel guilty,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that it's a kind of weakness.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe that's a message that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you've grown up with.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What can I say? That's just my father's way.,Client,neutral,undefined
But is it your way?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hey, it works for him.",Client,neutral,undefined
Doesn't necessarily make him an asshole. People love my father.,Client,depression,undefined
My wife is crazy about him.,Client,depression,undefined
You should see him at...,Client,depression,undefined
At family dinners. He's got her off in a corner and...,Client,depression,undefined
telling jokes and... I don't know. She appreciates him.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe that's why we lasted as long as we did.,Client,disgust,undefined
You say lasted as if it was past tense.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, actually, that's why I came to see you today.",Client,neutral,undefined
There's this issue with my wife.,Client,neutral,undefined
"What happened was, when I came home from my trip,",Client,depression,undefined
"it was late,",Client,depression,undefined
and the kids were already asleep.,Client,depression,undefined
And I saw my wife.,Client,depression,undefined
"What do you mean, you saw your wife?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I looked at her.,Client,disgust,undefined
I really looked at her.,Client,disgust,undefined
She was sleeping in front of the television.,Client,depression,undefined
"For an hour, an hour and a half nonstop",Client,depression,undefined
I sat there without taking my eyes off her.,Client,depression,undefined
When was the last time you watched your wife sleep for an hour straight?,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, I usually fall asleep before she does.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, try it once, you'll be surprised.",Client,neutral,undefined
What'll surprise me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What you'll discover...,Client,neutral,undefined
"About her,",Client,neutral,undefined
about yourself.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was looking at her,",Client,depression,undefined
looking at every inch of her body.,Client,depression,undefined
And I said to myself...,Client,depression,undefined
"Who the hell is this woman,",Client,depression,undefined
sleeping on the sofa in front of the tv?,Client,depression,undefined
What the hell does she know about me?,Client,depression,undefined
What does she think she knows about me?,Client,depression,undefined
"And what the hell am I doing,",Client,depression,undefined
living with her,Client,depression,undefined
"in the same living room, in the same house",Client,depression,undefined
with the same kids for the past 15 years?,Client,depression,undefined
Understand?,Client,depression,undefined
"And i'm sitting there opposite her, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
She doesn't imagine what's going through my head.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you know what happened?,Client,disgust,undefined
She starts grinding her teeth.,Client,disgust,undefined
Now it's the first time i ever saw her grind her teeth in her sleep.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And I'm talking something sick,",Client,disgust,undefined
frightening.,Client,disgust,undefined
The sound that came out of her mouth... How do you...,Client,disgust,undefined
"You could cut diamonds between her teeth, okay?",Client,disgust,undefined
It really fucked me up.,Client,disgust,undefined
Sounds pretty upsetting.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Shocking, I tell you.",Client,disgust,undefined
And suddenly I understood. For the past 15 years,Client,neutral,undefined
this woman's been so busy pretending that everything's okay,Client,neutral,undefined
"flowing. She's a model mother, a model wife,",Client,neutral,undefined
an outstanding lecturer at a communications college.,Client,neutral,undefined
Very impressive in front of my fellow pilots. And it turns out,Client,neutral,undefined
she takes it all out on her teeth at night.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, that's pretty common, actually.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They don't think it has anything to do with stress.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It has to do with flaws in the structure of the jaw.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You really believe that?,Client,disgust,undefined
"No, it's connected to her stress.",Client,disgust,undefined
In what way?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
In what...,Client,depression,undefined
She is a totally repressed person.,Client,depression,undefined
"And all her repressions come out at night,",Client,depression,undefined
in her sleep.,Client,depression,undefined
So she grinds her teeth.,Client,neutral,undefined
"em, You think Michaela may have trouble with her feelings too?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You think I don't feel? Wait till you meet her.,Client,joy,undefined
Everything is just like clockwork.,Client,joy,undefined
"Clockwork, that's what...",Client,joy,undefined
It's clockwork.,Client,joy,undefined
The kids have been going to bed at the same hour,Client,neutral,undefined
since they were two days old.,Client,neutral,undefined
They got sick on a fixed date.,Client,neutral,undefined
We'd have sex,Client,neutral,undefined
on a fixed date In a fixed position. And Michaela even farts,Client,joy,undefined
once a year on a fixed date.,Client,joy,undefined
Once a year,Client,joy,undefined
"on the night after Easter Sunday she farts. She lets herself fart once,",Client,joy,undefined
"maybe twice, a little one, not that much. Then it's over.",Client,joy,undefined
No farting for the rest of the year.,Client,joy,undefined
"Man, she's a programmed person.",Client,neutral,undefined
Every emotion is under control.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sounds like you're a little angry with her.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, What... Why...",Client,neutral,undefined
Just the way you talk about her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
No. Takes a lot more than michaela's schedule to make me angry.,Client,neutral,undefined
I got the impression before when you were speaking that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Maybe you're a little angry with yourself, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I mean, you went all the way to Iraq and you couldn't feel anything.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Have you spoken to Michaela about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of course. Over our morning coffee.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She says, Yes, honey. I grind my teeth.",Client,neutral,undefined
You only noticed it now? You are such a sweetheart.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's what I call love.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Then she said, Baby, please cut down on your coffee.",Client,neutral,undefined
Remember what the doctor said?,Client,neutral,undefined
Since my heart attack she lets me have one cup of coffee a day.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And that battery acid you gave me, that's not coffee.",Client,neutral,undefined
That doesn't count.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"So you don't like Michaela worrying about you,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
treating you like you're sick?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's just... It's like she's on a mission.,Client,depression,undefined
To get me back up in the air asap. She says i'm fit as a fiddle,Client,depression,undefined
and I need to be knocking on the navy's door to get back.,Client,depression,undefined
How long has it been since you've flown?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Two months since my heart attack.,Client,depression,undefined
It must be hard,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"to be away from that world,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Not to be part of what used to be the...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
The center of your life.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"First of all, i'm still one of them. So you can relax on that.",Client,joy,undefined
"But meanwhile, sitting at home thinking about the possibility that you...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
That you might never fly again.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Of course i'll fly again.,Client,neutral,undefined
People with worse injuries have bounced back.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Do you want to go back, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
When the time is right.,Client,neutral,undefined
But Michaela's dying for me to go back.,Client,neutral,undefined
And at night she grinds her teeth like some kind of...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Alex, it's not like she changed overnight.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What are you saying?,Client,neutral,undefined
I think there are things about michael that really bother you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because they reflect something,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
inside you that you can't live with.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Like what?,Client,neutral,undefined
Like her passion for you to fly again.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm not 100% convinced that you actually want to go back.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe because...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're having trouble forgiving yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Okay, all of this just reinforces my decision to leave home.",Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, I don't think...",Client,disgust,undefined
It's pointless to drag this out for years.,Client,disgust,undefined
When a person decides he's not in love with his spouse,Client,disgust,undefined
he shouldn't have to put off leaving home. Isn't that so?,Client,disgust,undefined
It's over. it's dead.,Client,disgust,undefined
I've had friends who've reached this conclusion.,Client,depression,undefined
They go to 3 years of couples therapy and they end up separating.,Client,depression,undefined
So what's the use? I say cut that shit.,Client,depression,undefined
Don't you think that's a little extreme?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, it is possible to overcome a crisis.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you know what I realized?,Client,neutral,undefined
That I was never in love with her.,Client,neutral,undefined
With Michaela.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you know what that means? What a terrible realization that is?,Client,depression,undefined
What do you expect me to do?,Client,depression,undefined
Find a lover like my dad?,Client,disgust,undefined
Start coming home late at night? I don't even have a good excuse anymore.,Client,disgust,undefined
I won't do anything but sit on my ass and watch tv.,Client,depression,undefined
So what?,Client,depression,undefined
You look upset.,Client,depression,undefined
"No, i'm just...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm just a little concerned.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, don't be.",Client,depression,undefined
I feel a great relief.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, i'm sure.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
There must be tremendous relief in just...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
walking away.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm not convinced it's the solution.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Why not?,Client,neutral,undefined
I suppose because i ask myself:,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Who are you really leaving?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you're leaving her because she's such a frightening reflection of you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Maybe you're leaving yourself,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
not your wife.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's irrelevant.,Client,neutral,undefined
I have no reason to go back. We're finished. We're done.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you said anything to her about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not yet.,Client,neutral,undefined
I thought i'd consult with you first.,Client,depression,undefined
Is this really a consultation?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Because you know something?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Again, I feel like I'm a rubber stamp for decision that you've already made.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"On the contrary, this meeting clinched the matter, not before.",Client,neutral,undefined
You can take credit for it.,Client,joy,undefined
Why are you always giving me credit?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, it's not that you give me credit.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What you're really doing is you're asking me,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to accept responsibility for your big decisions.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you know what?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"It's not me making these decisions, it's you.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You knew before you walked through that door,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that you were gonna go back to iraq.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You knew before you ever brought up the subject of Michaela's teeth grinding,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that your marriage was deeply in trouble.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
These aren't conclusions that you've come to here on this couch,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
in the last week with my permission.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Aren't these things that have been,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"boiling over inside you for a very very long time, alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I got to go.,Client,depression,undefined
"Like you say, my time is up.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Hey, don't worry.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'll keep you posted.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you write my evaluation?,Client,anger,undefined
No.,Client,anger,undefined
Did you?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What the fuck?!,Client,anger,undefined
Why didn't you?,Client,anger,undefined
That's why i'm here.,Client,anger,undefined
"That's all i need from you,",Client,anger,undefined
That stupid evaluation.,Client,anger,undefined
"Actually, i don't think i know you",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
quite well enough,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yet, Sophie.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So why didn't you write yours?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, i tried",Client,neutral,undefined
"With my dad, but,",Client,neutral,undefined
But he's too busy with his exhibition.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's an artist?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
A photographer.,Client,neutral,undefined
He hates the word artist.,Client,neutral,undefined
He always has his exhibitions at home,Client,neutral,undefined
Because he's against galleries.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway,",Client,neutral,undefined
he said it was totally unprofessional,Client,neutral,undefined
For me to write my own evaluation,Client,neutral,undefined
And that you sound like a quack.,Client,joy,undefined
Are you a quack?,Client,joy,undefined
"No, i am not a quack.",Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
I promise.,Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
And then i tried to write it with my mom.,Client,neutral,undefined
That didn't work--,Client,neutral,undefined
Obviously.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you say obviously?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Because she's a total tool,Client,disgust,undefined
and a retard.,Client,disgust,undefined
A tool and a retard?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,joy,undefined
"We got in a fight. And i was like,",Client,neutral,undefined
i so do not need this right now.,Client,neutral,undefined
So i left.,Client,neutral,undefined
I went to this apartment near the gym,Client,depression,undefined
Where the foreign girls stay.,Client,depression,undefined
"I told them my parents were going out of town, so,",Client,depression,undefined
they let me crash there.,Client,depression,undefined
And then i tried to get Cy,Client,neutral,undefined
"to help me write it,",Client,neutral,undefined
But he's too busy getting everyone,Client,neutral,undefined
"ready to leave for training camp, so,",Client,neutral,undefined
So i didn't do it.,Client,neutral,undefined
So why did you and your mom get into a fight,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Trying to write the evaluation together?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She actually wanted to write it for me.,Client,depression,undefined
"And i was like, no, mom, i can do it myself.",Client,depression,undefined
"And she was like, we'll be here",Client,depression,undefined
until the next olympics.,Client,depression,undefined
"And i was like, bite me.",Client,disgust,undefined
So i left.,Client,disgust,undefined
So you didn't want her to write it.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You just,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"wanted her to help you,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"What, phrase it?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It doesn't matter.,Client,neutral,undefined
"We got in a fight, for a change.",Client,neutral,undefined
"But this time, Sophie,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You left home.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So?,Client,depression,undefined
Have you done that before?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
So something was different,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
about this particular fight.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What do you think it was that was different?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you-- Did you come from home,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Or did you come from the gym today?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The gym.,Client,neutral,undefined
Gym-- Is that far away?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's why i was late.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sophie,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Before you arrived, i, uh--",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"I got a phone call, and, um,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
i heard you asking somebody,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
To let you out of the car.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"well, i-- I tried to call you",Client,disgust,undefined
"to tell you i was on my way,",Client,disgust,undefined
"But, um, then i figured",Client,disgust,undefined
"That we were like five minutes away, so...",Client,disgust,undefined
i thought i hung up,Client,disgust,undefined
before the call went through.,Client,disgust,undefined
Was that your father?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You could've hung up, you know?",Client,anger,undefined
Or do you always eavesdrop,Client,anger,undefined
on other people's conversations?,Client,anger,undefined
"Sophie, if you were my patient,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
i'd ask if you thought,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was a coincidence that i,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
overheard that conversation.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But i'm not your patient.,Client,anger,undefined
I wouldn't see a therapist,Client,anger,undefined
Who i thought was an eavesdropper.,Client,anger,undefined
I'd be out of here.,Client,anger,undefined
So did your dad bring you in?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I told you, i had a fight with him!",Client,anger,undefined
I thought you said the fight was with your mom.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's really none of your business,Client,depression,undefined
who i came here with.,Client,depression,undefined
Earlier on you said that you'd like,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Kate to go to the gym with you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"What would you like Kate to,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
to tell the girls at the gym?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Your daughter's clothes are gross.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why is that funny?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, why are they gross?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
They're hideous.,Client,anger,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm really not getting my,Client,disgust,undefined
"evaluation today, am i?",Client,disgust,undefined
This is stupid.,Client,disgust,undefined
I should go. Are my clothes dry yet?,Client,depression,undefined
I wouldn't think so.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, can you check?",Client,depression,undefined
"And call Kate, because i need her",Client,depression,undefined
to help me put them back on.,Client,depression,undefined
You people are such tools.,Client,anger,undefined
I can't believe you get paid for this.,Client,anger,undefined
Why didn't you tell me before,Client,anger,undefined
that you heard my conversation?,Client,anger,undefined
I was waiting for you to tell me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So now i'm a liar too?,Client,depression,undefined
"I did't say you were a liar, Sophie.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's what you're thinking.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you need Kate to go to the gym with you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't need her to.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can i ask you something?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

"The whole place, it reeks of hypocrisy.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Did you know, like, every girl there is",Client,disgust,undefined
a Mia or an Anna except me?,Client,disgust,undefined
They know it.,Client,disgust,undefined
They just don't do anything about it.,Client,disgust,undefined
They encourage it.,Client,disgust,undefined
"These girls, Anna and Mia,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Are they friends of yours?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You don't know these girls?,Client,joy,undefined
"They're fun girls, especially Anna.",Client,joy,undefined

You can't keep your weight down otherwise.,Client,depression,undefined
You can't keep your weight down otherwise.,Client,depression,undefined
"And if you're not skinny you can't compete, so,",Client,depression,undefined
"So you have no choice, you have to.",Client,depression,undefined
But who says you can't compete?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Cy and Regina.,Client,depression,undefined
Regina is our physical trainer.,Client,depression,undefined
All the girls follow Cy around,Client,neutral,undefined

"Cy, was that okay?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Cy, can you show me how to do that move?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Cy, i'm about to fall. Quick,",Client,neutral,undefined

But not Regina 'Cause she's russian.,Client,neutral,undefined
So her bullshit detector is like nuclear.,Client,neutral,undefined
And at the end of the day,Client,neutral,undefined
Cy and Regina decide everhing--,Client,neutral,undefined
"Who competes,",Client,neutral,undefined
who's gained weight and can't compete.,Client,neutral,undefined
"After my accident,",Client,depression,undefined
Karen Scott and Audrey England,Client,depression,undefined
came to visit me.,Client,depression,undefined
"They had these pathetic looks on their faces, like,",Client,depression,undefined
Like they felt my pain.,Client,depression,undefined
But i knew they were happy.,Client,depression,undefined
I would have been happy if something,Client,depression,undefined
had happened to one of them,Client,depression,undefined
Right before the olympic tryouts.,Client,depression,undefined
"Honestly,",Client,depression,undefined
"If it was me,",Client,depression,undefined
I would have done what Shirley did.,Client,depression,undefined
She didn't even come.,Client,depression,undefined
"Me and her, we're like the best",Client,depression,undefined
ones there by far.,Client,depression,undefined
"It was like she was saying,",Client,depression,undefined

So they're leaving tomorrow,Client,depression,undefined
For training camp in California,Client,depression,undefined

The money people.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway,",Client,depression,undefined
I picked a fight with him.,Client,depression,undefined

It wasn't his fault.,Client,depression,undefined
Why is it so important for you,Therapist,neutral,Open question
to go with them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
To the camp?,Client,depression,undefined
Everyone will be there.,Client,depression,undefined
"You mean, Karen, Audrey and Shirley?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But-- But you said you can't stand them.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said you don't even like them.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And you can't train anyway, so,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
i don't understand why,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
it's so important to you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's not important.,Client,depression,undefined
But i was looking forward to it.,Client,depression,undefined
"Sounds like, um...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"you and Cy are, uh--",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're very close.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

"Despite the fact that you had an injury, and,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement

It was on his way.,Client,depression,undefined
He wants me to come to the camp,Client,depression,undefined

But no.,Client,depression,undefined
He couldn't make them pay for Darlene either.,Client,depression,undefined
Darlene? ,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

You have good memory for an old fart.,Client,joy,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,joy,Open question
So why did you stop?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They didn't need me anymore.,Client,neutral,undefined
Dana used to have all these,Client,neutral,undefined
"breathing problems, but,",Client,neutral,undefined
then she had this surgery,Client,neutral,undefined
"and they got better, and,",Client,neutral,undefined
And darlene came back from Wisconsin,Client,neutral,undefined
Where she was like,Client,neutral,undefined
learning to process her own,Client,neutral,undefined

So they didn't need me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you work there for a long time?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sort of.,Client,neutral,undefined
And Dana must have become very fond of you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Did she become attached to you?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Yeah.,Client,joy,undefined
She's the cutest.,Client,joy,undefined
She hasn't stopped talking,Client,joy,undefined
about me since i left.,Client,joy,undefined
She said she doesn't want to go to California,Client,joy,undefined
If i'm not going to be there.,Client,joy,undefined
They told her that i wouldn't,Client,depression,undefined
be able to babysit her anymore,Client,depression,undefined
Cause i'd had this accident.,Client,depression,undefined
"But see, i'd already told her before",Client,depression,undefined
That i couldn't keep living with them,Client,depression,undefined
once her mom came home.,Client,depression,undefined
"I waed to prepare her, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
But they didn't tell me,Client,disgust,undefined
"what they were telling her, so,",Client,disgust,undefined
the whole lie became mixed up in her head.,Client,disgust,undefined
What?,Client,disgust,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You look scared all of a sudden.,Client,depression,undefined
I look scared?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Like you're looking at a psycho or something.,Client,depression,undefined

Your casts together. Do you you remember?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"And you said,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

You said that when Darlene came home,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You knew you couldn't keep on living there.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I never said i lived there.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you told dana you wouldn't,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
be able to go on living there.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, because she's a child",Client,depression,undefined
"But, so it felt to her like i lived there.",Client,depression,undefined
"It was just,",Client,depression,undefined
"Cause she'd go to school and,",Client,depression,undefined
"come back and i'd be there, and,",Client,depression,undefined

So,Client,depression,undefined
even when he was home she'd nt me to stay--,Client,depression,undefined
"Cook them dinner, do her homework with her.",Client,depression,undefined
Sometimes she'd wake up screaming,Client,depression,undefined
Because she stopped breathing in her sleep.,Client,depression,undefined
Cy told me that.,Client,depression,undefined
What the hell is going on here?,Client,anger,undefined
"What do you mean,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
what the hell is going on here?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
My dad was right. I'll go to therapy,Client,depression,undefined
And i'll end up a psycho,Client,depression,undefined
Just like your daughter.,Client,depression,undefined
Everyone thinks she's a freak.,Client,depression,undefined
"Are you trying to hurt me, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,disgust,undefined
But you should know what people say about her.,Client,disgust,undefined
She had this thing with this guy,Client,disgust,undefined
And afterwards,Client,disgust,undefined
everyone says she'd turned out psycho,Client,disgust,undefined
Cause her dad is a shrink.,Client,disgust,undefined
Shrinks' kids are psycho. Everyone knows that.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, maybe that's because--",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because some people are afraid of therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They're afraid of what they might find out.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They're afraid that it might,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
touch those wounds,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

I'm fine.,Client,anger,undefined
You wanna worry about a little girl?,Client,anger,undefined
Worry about your own kid.,Client,anger,undefined
Does it bother you that people,Therapist,neutral,Open question
talk about my daughter?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why would it bother me?,Client,neutral,undefined
Because maybe you know what it feels like.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe I don't.,Client,anger,undefined
We were talking,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
about your coach And then suddenly,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you brought up the story of my daughter.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, because i thought you should know.",Client,neutral,undefined
Are there people who say things,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

"You know, Sophie, sometimes",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
when people are jealous,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They say things to hurt us,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because they envy us.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think that some,Therapist,neutral,Open question

"jealous of you, and,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
how close your relationship is with Cy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Don't talk to me like i'm a child, please.",Client,disgust,undefined

To tell me something that,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
other people say about you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are my clothes dry yet?,Client,disgust,undefined

What about your dad?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I told you, i had a fight with him.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Not a real fight, but he pissed me off.",Client,disgust,undefined
He knows how much i wanted,Client,disgust,undefined
to go to that training camp with them,Client,disgust,undefined
And he didn't even offer to pay.,Client,disgust,undefined
I wouldn't have taken his money anyway.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Obviously, the exhibitions are expensive, but--",Client,disgust,undefined
Why is it so important for you,Therapist,neutral,Open question

I remember the whole world was silent.,Client,depression,undefined
"Not just silent, soundless.",Client,depression,undefined
"You know, like there had never been",Client,depression,undefined
"any noise ever,",Client,depression,undefined
Not even that hum that you hear,Client,depression,undefined

when i got to the hospital.,Client,depression,undefined
There was no way.,Client,disgust,undefined
They can't even sit in the,Client,disgust,undefined
same section at my meets.,Client,disgust,undefined
I have to wave to two different,Client,disgust,undefined
spots after my routine. I look schizo.,Client,disgust,undefined
I tried to sit up.,Client,sadness,undefined
I told the emt that i wanted,Client,sadness,undefined
to see the outside.,Client,sadness,undefined
Why ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, when you see an ambulance",Client,depression,undefined
"Tearing down the street, you turn and look.",Client,depression,undefined
"Well, i wanted to see what it was like",Client,depression,undefined
Being on the inside looking out.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, seeing people's faces",Client,depression,undefined
"on the sidewalk Wondering,",Client,depression,undefined
who's in there? Is she going to be okay?,Client,depression,undefined
I couldn't sit up.,Client,depression,undefined
"The E.M.T., She had this mirror",Client,depression,undefined
that she tried to angle,Client,depression,undefined
"So that i could see out,",Client,depression,undefined
But all i could see was myself.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And i remember thinking,",Client,disgust,undefined
"both arms, Sophie?",Client,disgust,undefined
"Did it have to be both arms, you idiot?",Client,disgust,undefined
Our time is up.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"We'll, um--",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
We'll take it up there,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
When you come back next week.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
You're not going to training camp,Client,joy,undefined
with everyone else in the universe?,Client,joy,undefined
I'll go get your clothes,Therapist,neutral,Others
And call Kate.,Therapist,neutral,Others
It's...,Client,depression,undefined
It's true.,Client,depression,undefined
Kate's been...,Client,depression,undefined
She's been seeing...,Client,depression,undefined
this guy.,Client,depression,undefined
"Supermarket manager, employment agency guy...",Client,depression,undefined
"I forget what he does, but anyway,",Client,depression,undefined
"he's divorced,",Client,depression,undefined
got a kid.,Client,depression,undefined
She made sure to tell me all the details.,Client,depression,undefined
Did she say how long?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Everything's gone to hell...,Client,depression,undefined
"Patients, family.",Client,depression,undefined
If I was...,Client,depression,undefined
"If I was into astrology, I'd say there was something",Client,depression,undefined
"cosmic going on, planets colliding somewhere.",Client,depression,undefined
"First, one of my patients... The pilot I was telling you about...",Client,neutral,undefined
He's leaving his wife.,Client,neutral,undefined
Just like that.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She grinds her teeth in her sleep, so marriage over.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And the 16-year-old, the gymnast? She's having an affair",Client,neutral,undefined
"with this guy in his mid-40s, married guy...",Client,neutral,undefined
Her coach. At least I think that's what she's hinting at.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she also goes to the same school as my daughter,Client,neutral,undefined
so I had the pleasure of finding out that...,Client,depression,undefined
Rosie was having a... A thing...,Client,depression,undefined
with this boy at school.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't even know what a thing is. I don't even know if it's true.,Client,depression,undefined
I asked her. I got nowhere.,Client,depression,undefined
She wouldn't tell me anything.,Client,depression,undefined
And then finally...Kate...,Client,disgust,undefined
Is it me?,Client,disgust,undefined
Kate says it is.,Client,disgust,undefined
She says it's my fault.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I don't see her, that's she's invisible.",Client,depression,undefined
"She says I don't see the kids either, they're invisible too.",Client,depression,undefined
"As far as I know, Rosie could be having sex with a drug addict.",Client,depression,undefined
Everybody talks about her at school... at least that's what she said.,Client,depression,undefined
Who said? Kate said that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I'm lost, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"The girl, Sophie... the gymnast.",Client,depression,undefined
You talk about 10 things at once.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, she's in the same grade as Rosie.",Client,depression,undefined
Let's focus on Kate.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"What am I supposed to do, Gina?",Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, what...",Client,disgust,undefined
what am I supposed to do...,Client,disgust,undefined
now?,Client,disgust,undefined
Did she say what she thinks will happen now,Therapist,neutral,Open question
between the two of you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. She said it's... She said it's up to me.,Client,disgust,undefined
What do you think that means?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You tell me.,Client,disgust,undefined
She's banging some insurance salesman and it's up to me?,Client,disgust,undefined
She gave me all the details.,Client,disgust,undefined
"She blows him, she screws him...",Client,disgust,undefined
It's like a porno film.,Client,disgust,undefined
She told you that?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Absolutely.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, my conception...",Client,disgust,undefined
maybe I should say,Client,disgust,undefined
my misconception of Kate is that everything...,Client,disgust,undefined
Everything about sex was always connected to,Client,disgust,undefined
intimacy for her.,Client,disgust,undefined
There was never anything weird or dirty about sex.,Client,disgust,undefined
It was always about intimacy.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Now I feel if someone throws the word intimacy at me,",Client,disgust,undefined
I want to punch her in the mouth.,Client,disgust,undefined
Punch her in the mouth?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What?,Client,depression,undefined
You said punch her.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You know, all that bullshit that I thought meant",Client,depression,undefined
intimacy to her...,Client,depression,undefined
"The candles, the backrubs, feeling safe.",Client,depression,undefined
"Meanwhile she's in her own porno film,",Client,disgust,undefined
fucking this...,Client,disgust,undefined
This guy.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm trying to figure out why she would tell you graphic details.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because she wanted to hurt me.,Client,disgust,undefined
Did you ask for details?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I just wanted to...,Client,disgust,undefined
"I wanted to get a grasp of the situation, you know?",Client,disgust,undefined
She made sure you wouldn't ignore what she was saying.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think you knew what was going on.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Last week when we spoke, I think you knew.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm sure Kate sensed that as well... your suspicion.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe I'm wrong.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I knew.,Client,neutral,undefined
I did know.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You'd think that would make it easier, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
Almost threw her out of the house.,Client,depression,undefined
"It was like, You hurt me, Okay,",Client,anger,undefined
I'm gonna hurt you. Now just get the fuck out of here.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, there are a thousand ways",Client,disgust,undefined
that people can deal with these things.,Client,disgust,undefined
"We could have gone to therapy, for example.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, not everybody has to fuck around.",Client,disgust,undefined
What's that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Coldex Night.,Client,neutral,undefined
They're supposed to be stronger than Coldex Day.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've had two of them already. They kind of make you a bit stoned.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Do you want some tea, Paul?",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Water would be good, thanks.",Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I had a session yesterday with that...,Client,depression,undefined
Thanks.,Client,depression,undefined
With that couple who called me a...,Client,depression,undefined
Who called me a murderer.,Client,depression,undefined
"In the middle of the session,",Client,depression,undefined
she runs to the bathroom and she starts to bleed.,Client,depression,undefined
What happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Miscarriage.,Client,depression,undefined
My God.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It was pretty scary.,Client,depression,undefined
Is she allright?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think she's fine.,Client,depression,undefined
"I just spoke to her at the hospital. They're running some tests,",Client,depression,undefined
but she seems to be okay.,Client,depression,undefined
At least I'm not a murderer.,Client,depression,undefined
Though I wouldn't be surprised if the husband blamed me for everything.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, stress as a result of therapy.",Client,depression,undefined
It's possible.,Client,depression,undefined
"Ironically,",Client,depression,undefined
they'd both just kind of worked out their problem.,Client,depression,undefined
"They weren't arguing, which for them, is a major accomplishment.",Client,depression,undefined
And he said to me:,Client,depression,undefined
This is our last session.,Client,depression,undefined
And then...,Client,depression,undefined
Then it happened.,Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, I was trying to get the blood out of the couch,",Client,depression,undefined
"'cause when she got up, she left a stain,",Client,depression,undefined
and Kate walks into the room.,Client,depression,undefined
And she looks around and she says...,Client,depression,undefined
What goes on in this office?,Client,depression,undefined
haha,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Anyway...,Client,depression,undefined
Quite a week.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Quite a week.,Client,neutral,undefined
Ultimatums from two women.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Kate and Laura.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Laura?,Client,neutral,undefined
She tells you she's in love with you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What's... What are we going back to that for?,Client,depression,undefined
I was talking about something completely different.,Client,depression,undefined
You don't think it's relevant? You describe two women attacking you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Two women? What about three women?,Client,neutral,undefined
Does it feel like I'm attacking?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe that's why you're taking pills to protect yourself against me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I have a cold, see?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Last week you called me a sleepy spider,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
in wait.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Were you...,Client,neutral,undefined
Were you insulted by that?,Client,neutral,undefined
I take it back.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're not sleepy.,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you agree that your relationship with Kate has been...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"a wall between you and your patients so that you're safe,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
you're not attracted to them?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Attraction's... It's not a problem.,Client,neutral,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Freud, Messer, Davies, all the big guys,",Client,neutral,undefined
"they all talk about how attraction is inevitable, it's part of therapy.",Client,neutral,undefined
"But if you brush it under the rug, the message you're giving to the patient",Client,neutral,undefined
"is that their feelings are perverse, are dangerous.",Client,neutral,undefined
Their feelings? I'm talking about your feelings.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm not worried that Laura will try and break down the wall on her own.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm worried that you want her to.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The wall?,Client,neutral,undefined
What is this metaphor?,Client,neutral,undefined
My wife is a wall?,Client,neutral,undefined
You don't agree?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm not hiding from my patients.,Client,neutral,undefined
That essay that Bolas wrote about...,Client,neutral,undefined
Forget about Bolas.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Every time we go deeper, you reach for some theory...",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
These male therapists tormented by lust for their patients. Right?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I mention Laura and that's who you start quoting.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
But why are we even talking about Laura?,Client,neutral,undefined
Because I want you to hear what you're saying.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That you're surrounded by women who demand,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you respond and love and,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"be angry and feel,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you face your feelings.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did I mention that Laura is...,Client,neutral,undefined
Is getting married in June?,Client,neutral,undefined
So Laura's over.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's finished.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If anyone wants to pull down a wall, it's Kate.",Client,depression,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Secrecy. She...,Client,depression,undefined
She hates it. She hates that I can't share it.,Client,depression,undefined
You mean work?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She resents my office.,Client,disgust,undefined
It's like enemy territory to her. She's always trying to make it,Client,disgust,undefined
her space... a piece of it.,Client,disgust,undefined
Like Let's get a new sofa.,Client,neutral,undefined
Or new blinds or a rug or something.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you let her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I don't.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I agree with her. It's not her space.,Client,neutral,undefined
"There was a time when I used to talk about my patients, when Ian was a kid.",Client,neutral,undefined
I would share... share details.,Client,neutral,undefined
With Kate. You don't mean Ian.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Both of them at the dinner table.,Client,neutral,undefined
I see that look of horror on your face.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I was pretty discreet actually. I never mentioned any names.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If someone mentioned rats, I'd say,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I had a patient with a fear of rats,",Client,neutral,undefined
"dreamed about rats every night. You know, stuff like that.",Client,neutral,undefined
You don't do that now?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But I remember when Ian was about 10,",Client,neutral,undefined
"he asked me, Dad, what's an alcoholic?",Client,neutral,undefined
And I told him about this patient of mine,Client,neutral,undefined
who needed a drink actually to get out of bed in the morning.,Client,neutral,undefined
One day this man came up to the office and he was...,Client,neutral,undefined
"kind of staggering and Ian said, Dad, is that the alcoholic?",Client,neutral,undefined
You were careless.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"This situation now, I think...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
There's more at stake.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you agree?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because we're talking about a woman?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sexual attraction.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Can I ask you a question?,Client,neutral,undefined
You're in the middle of a session and a patient needed to use the bathroom,Client,neutral,undefined
and your bathroom is blocked up.,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you let them use the bathroom in your house?,Client,neutral,undefined
Did that happen?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Laura said that she had to pee.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I told her, Well, the toilet's blocked up.",Client,neutral,undefined
So she headed for the door of the house and...,Client,neutral,undefined
I freaked out. I jumped up and I stopped her.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm keeping your metaphor going here. I hope you appreciate that about the...,Client,neutral,undefined
She tried to scale the wall.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
There's always a patient who wants to know about you...,Client,neutral,undefined
More about your private self.,Client,neutral,undefined
Anyway...,Client,neutral,undefined
What did you do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I jumped up. I panicked.,Client,neutral,undefined
What made you panic?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She was doing it on purpose, I felt.",Client,neutral,undefined
"She was doing it on purpose, I felt.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I thought, Why can't she hold it for another 10 minutes?",Client,neutral,undefined
Why did I panic?,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know really.,Client,depression,undefined
Has that ever happened with another patient?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Sophie, the gymnast...",Client,neutral,undefined
She came in last week and...,Client,neutral,undefined
it had been raining and she was completely soaked.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I let her change into my daughter's clothes.,Client,neutral,undefined
That didn't make you uncomfortable?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No,Client,neutral,undefined
It's a lot more intimate than using the bathroom...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Rosie's clothes.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"well, She had casts on both her arms from the accident.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And she held up her hands like this and she said,",Client,neutral,undefined
Undress me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So, I got Kate to come in and help her.",Client,neutral,undefined
How old did you say she was?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
16,Client,neutral,undefined
She's the girl who's sleeping with her adult coach?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She <i>might</i> be sleeping with her coach.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's a loaded situation, her asking you to undress her.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She was messing with me.,Client,depression,undefined
You had no problem handling that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You had Kate help her, undress her, give her your daughter's clothes.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"But when Laura needs to use the bathroom, you freak out.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Why is that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Laura is a woman.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sophie's just a... she's just a child.,Client,neutral,undefined
Shouldn't that make it easier?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
umm,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, there was... There was a part of me",Client,depression,undefined
"that really wanted Laura to go through the door,",Client,depression,undefined
to see where I live.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe to... to see Kate.,Client,depression,undefined
You wanted that?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Was that what scared you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you discuss what Laura told you last week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She said that the reason that she was going to marry this guy,",Client,depression,undefined
"this boyfriend Andrew, was because I told her I wasn't interested.",Client,depression,undefined
"I know what you're thinking, but I made it really clear.",Client,depression,undefined
I said nothing,Client,depression,undefined
is going to happen between us.,Client,depression,undefined
Good.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm... I'm just...,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm not going to play along. This is not going to happen.,Client,disgust,undefined
"In your mind,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
is there any possibility that the affair could become a reality?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, in your mind.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Look, I have to admit sometimes, it's... It's flattering.",Client,neutral,undefined
I can't help but enjoy the feeling.,Client,disgust,undefined
But I told her no.,Client,depression,undefined
"I said, This cannot happen.",Client,depression,undefined
You cannot go through that door. There are limits.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Is that what upset you, that she was testing you?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's not that abstract.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's a beautiful woman.,Client,depression,undefined
She says she wants to have sex with me.,Client,depression,undefined
"I know what's in her head,",Client,disgust,undefined
so I don't want her going through the door and maybe bumping into Kate.,Client,disgust,undefined
But you said you did want that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Some part of you wanted that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The point I'm making is that,Client,disgust,undefined
"I want Laura to understand that we can survive this,",Client,disgust,undefined
that any attraction that comes up between us I can handle.,Client,disgust,undefined
I am not going to let this derail the therapy.,Client,disgust,undefined
Her wanting to sleep with you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
How did she put it exactly?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That she knows that...,Client,depression,undefined
I want her.,Client,depression,undefined
That she knows that...,Client,depression,undefined
I want her.,Client,depression,undefined
She said that she wants to...,Client,depression,undefined
to fuck me and that she knows that I want to fuck her too.,Client,depression,undefined
"That's a lot to stave off,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
that kind of intensity.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
She can be very direct... Laura.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe that's why I panicked.,Client,depression,undefined
"Here's what I think, Paul,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"and you can accept this or tell me I'm interfering again, but",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"given the situation with Kate,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I think we... we might explore the option,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
of transferring Laura to another therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
What?,Client,disgust,undefined
Just hear me out on this.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Because Laura thinks she wants to sleep with me?,Client,disgust,undefined
Last week you thought we were already having sex.,Client,disgust,undefined
I thought you had an affair and you were trying to justify it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Thanks, Gina.",Client,disgust,undefined
I was wrong. I'm sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I jumped to conclusions.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You've reassured me.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But now this situation with Kate...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How emotional you are and the pressure you're under.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Listen to yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're injured. You're vulnerable. You're angry.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"This isn't me being stubborn, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think we should just discuss the possibility,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
that Laura's better off with a different therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"A female therapist, you mean.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, preferably.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"You, for instance?",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I'm retired, remember?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
This is so typical of you.,Client,anger,undefined
"You always begin by saying I hate to say this, but...",Client,anger,undefined
But...,Client,anger,undefined
And you lay some pronouncement on me that you've already been thinking about,Client,anger,undefined
"before you've come into the session. This isn't a debate club, you know?",Client,anger,undefined
It's not like we take a position and we hunt for ways to support it.,Client,anger,undefined
That's not what I'm doing. I'm listening.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You have Kate on one side and you have Laura on the other.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"But they're two totally different situations, Gina.",Client,anger,undefined
Are you saying that I pushed Kate into this situation?,Client,anger,undefined
That I created this environment at home,Client,anger,undefined
so that Kate could go fuck an insurance agent,Client,anger,undefined
because really I'm in love with Laura?,Client,anger,undefined
Isn't that your theory? Your notes somewhere?,Client,anger,undefined
Look at how you're reacting.,Therapist,neutral,Others
How am I reacting?,Client,anger,undefined
I am not sending Laura to another therapist.,Client,anger,undefined
End of story.,Client,anger,undefined
I can handle whatever comes up in the sessions.,Client,anger,undefined
That's why I'm here... Because I want you to help me to handle it.,Client,anger,undefined
"We just need to discuss this, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't want to pawn her off on somebody else.,Client,anger,undefined
But what's best for Laura?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Honestly, if it wasn't for Kate cheating...",Client,disgust,undefined
"I wouldn't be here, Gina.",Client,disgust,undefined
And we haven't talked about your comment the last time.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was pretty pissed off about that.,Client,neutral,undefined
About what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You made a crack about my father leaving my mother for a patient.,Client,neutral,undefined
What was that supposed to mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
That I can't treat Laura because of what my father did years ago?,Client,anger,undefined
"I'm not my father, for Christ's sake.",Client,anger,undefined
"No, you're not your father. I'm suggesting a pattern",Therapist,neutral,Approval
that might be threatening to you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Are you,Client,neutral,undefined
"or are you not, Gina, saying that because of my father,",Client,neutral,undefined
that I'm in danger of having an affair?,Client,neutral,undefined
My gut...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You can't answer it, can you?",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I can't.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"If I remember correctly, you were faced with the same scenario yourself.",Client,neutral,undefined
So maybe this really isn't about my father.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Maybe it's about you, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
Don't forget I was the one who referred Charlie to you.,Client,neutral,undefined
I remember he called me after one of your sessions.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he confessed to me that...,Client,neutral,undefined
"that he was in love with you. No, actually he went further.",Client,neutral,undefined
He said that you were in love with each other.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Maybe he was wrong, I don't know.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Either way, you needed to face that, and you didn't.",Client,neutral,undefined
You just ran off to England.,Client,neutral,undefined
You know what? I could not believe when that happened.,Client,depression,undefined
"That was a wake-up call for me,",Client,depression,undefined
watching you behave like that.,Client,depression,undefined
I didn't run away.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Come on,",Client,depression,undefined
a sabbatical with David? At that moment?,Client,depression,undefined
"By the way, is that what your novel is about?",Client,neutral,undefined
I figured.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You failed the same test yourself, Gina,",Client,neutral,undefined
but you abandoned a patient.,Client,depression,undefined
"He tried to get hold of you over the years, didn't he?",Client,depression,undefined
A few letters.,Therapist,depression,Self-disclosure
I didn't answer.,Therapist,depression,Self-disclosure
You do know that he died a few months ago?,Client,depression,undefined
Prostate cancer.,Client,depression,undefined
It was right after David and I couldn't go to another funeral.,Therapist,depression,Self-disclosure
I just couldn't... I couldn't face it.,Therapist,depression,Self-disclosure
"It's funny, you know? I was talking about Charlie the other day",Client,depression,undefined
to a patient of mine.,Client,depression,undefined
I was saying that I... I'd been to his funeral and that I was...,Client,depression,undefined
I couldn't feel sadness.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I was, you know, beating myself up about it.",Client,depression,undefined
"The truth is, I was...",Client,depression,undefined
"I was so disillusioned with you, Gina,",Client,depression,undefined
for keeping you on as a supervisor.,Client,depression,undefined
"After what you pulled with Charlie, I should have just walked out then.",Client,depression,undefined
You know that he never ever got over you?,Client,disgust,undefined
Since we're digging for the truth...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
May I ask how you really feel about Laura?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I haven't heard a clear answer. Not what you're going to do about her,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but how you feel.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Do you mean, am I attracted to her?",Client,neutral,undefined
Are you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Come on, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If I transferred every patient I was attracted to at some point,",Client,neutral,undefined
I wouldn't have any patients left.,Client,neutral,undefined
And it's not your place to say I should transfer a patient.,Client,disgust,undefined
It's like me telling that couple they should have an abortion.,Client,disgust,undefined
It's not what therapists do.,Client,disgust,undefined
We don't tell people how to run their lives.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm suggesting that we talk about stopping Laura's therapy,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
and look at your reaction.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Paul, do you really need another pill?",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I know. Tomorrow's Saturday. I can sleep all day Sunday.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't really care if they knock me out or not, really.",Client,neutral,undefined
What you're going through with Kate is so complicated.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah...,Client,neutral,undefined
Really sorry. You wouldn't believe what just happened to me. I...,Client,fear,undefined
I almost didn't make it here at all.,Client,fear,undefined
God!,Client,fear,undefined
I've got to calm down first.,Client,fear,undefined
"Can I get some water, please?",Client,fear,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"What, were you going to punish me for being late?",Client,fear,undefined
Sorry. Ahem. I don't know how that got there.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's yours?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yeah.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I thought someone left it here.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So, what happened? Why are you 25 minutes late?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Right.,Client,fear,undefined
"I took a cab here. We were flying down Madison, right,",Client,fear,undefined
and about 200 feet away from me is this dog.,Client,fear,undefined
"She... he... it tries to cross the street,",Client,fear,undefined
and you know it's impossible to cross that stretch of Madison.,Client,fear,undefined
"And of course he gets run over. Well, not run over, hit.",Client,fear,undefined
The car in front of us hit him so he ran into the street and another car hit him.,Client,fear,undefined
It was awful.,Client,fear,undefined
"Cars were playing Ping-Pong with him. It was like, ping... ping.",Client,fear,undefined
He didn't stand a chance.,Client,fear,undefined
"(Sighs) The cab I was in almost hit him, the driver stopped short",Client,fear,undefined
but then the car on the left hit him really hard.,Client,fear,undefined
I thought he was dead but he wasn't.,Client,fear,undefined
"I saw him limping across the street so I yelled at the driver to please stop,",Client,fear,undefined
but he couldn't because the traffic there would have caused a massive pile-up.,Client,fear,undefined
"But I couldn't not stop, you know. I mean, if the dog was alive I had to get him to a vet.",Client,fear,undefined
"I mean, didn't I? You would have pulled over.",Client,fear,undefined
Or maybe you wouldn't have given a damn.,Client,fear,undefined
I don't think everybody would pull over.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But you would have pulled over, Paul. I'm sure you would have.",Client,joy,undefined
You wouldn't have pulled over?,Client,neutral,undefined
I wouldn't have pulled over.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
No?,Client,neutral,undefined
I would have assumed the dog was dead and there wasn't anything I could do for him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Sure, I'd be sad just like you were but I wouldn't have pulled over.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I don't believe you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, anyway, I couldn't not stop, OK?",Client,neutral,undefined
"So I yelled at the driver to make a U-turn so I can get to the other side of the street,",Client,disgust,undefined
"but, shit, there's no U-turns.",Client,disgust,undefined
This idiot cabbie is telling me that wounded animals prefer to die alone,Client,disgust,undefined
just because he can't make a fucking U-turn.,Client,disgust,undefined
"So I yelled, Please, can you stop, I need to figure out what to do,",Client,disgust,undefined
"and then I looked at his dashboard and it's five to,",Client,disgust,undefined
and it's another 25 minutes to your office.,Client,disgust,undefined
It was incredibly frustrating.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sounds like it was.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Imagine, stop for a dog that may die anyway,",Client,neutral,undefined
and be very late.,Client,neutral,undefined
You would have been late anyway.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
"You were still very far away,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and it was already five to. Dog or no dog, you would have been 25 minutes late.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"The fact is you're never late, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I would have appreciated a call.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why are you like that?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why are you like that?,Client,neutral,undefined
Like what?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I don't know, er... Anti.",Client,neutral,undefined
Anti? Anti-what?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't know. Anti-me.,Client,disgust,undefined
I come feeling like shit for what I've witnessed,Client,disgust,undefined
and you're giving me a really negative vibe.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I don't think I'm being negative, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I'm just trying to understand you, that's all.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's possible that your being late today wasn't entirely coincidental.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you're trying to tell me something.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Oh. (Laughs),Client,joy,undefined
"What, I paid the dog to get run over in front of my face? I planted him?",Client,joy,undefined
"No, you were late already, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
(Sighs),Client,depression,undefined
"I don't know what you want from me, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
You have a very tight schedule.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're a busy woman.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You always call if there is a problem, an emergency at the hospital, or whatever.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You always call me. You are never late.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"In fact, very often you're early.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And so?,Client,neutral,undefined
So what do you think your being late is trying to say to me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Nothing, Paul. I... Nothing.",Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe... (Clears throat),Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Maybe you think that, erm...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That I'm not doing my job.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Cos if that's the case then we should talk about that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
About what?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Laura, I know you're upset about...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Look at you, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
Listen to you. You're scheming.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know you're up to something.,Client,depression,undefined
What am I up to?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It seems to me that the last few sessions have been difficult for you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"The last few months, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
"Very, very difficult.",Client,depression,undefined
And wonderful.,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you angry with me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Because if you are, then that's something we really need to talk about.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Maybe we need to talk about what good this therapy is doing you,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
or not doing.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Maybe you've had enough of it.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I was late and you're kicking me out of therapy?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Fucking hell! Use the belt, it's a more humane punishment.",Client,anger,undefined
"Look, I'm not angry, I have been, I...",Client,disgust,undefined
"I even thought about not coming here at all... Just as, like, a small protest.",Client,disgust,undefined
"When I left here last week, I phoned for a cab and the line was busy.",Client,disgust,undefined
"And I was just walking around in circles, round the block, round the garden.",Client,disgust,undefined
"And then I realised I was in shock, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
I felt like someone had punched me.,Client,disgust,undefined
That's how you felt?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like I'd punched you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do I need to remind you what you said to me right here at the door?,Client,depression,undefined
At the end of the last session?,Client,depression,undefined
"I have a feeling that if I hadn't mentioned it, you never would have brought it up.",Client,neutral,undefined
You would have hidden behind the rule that therapists don't initiate topics of conversation.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You're supposed to let the patient lead, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
You'd have taken advantage of that rule so we'd never talk about what happened again.,Client,neutral,undefined
What would you like to talk about today?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You act as if you don't know me, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
"That's what pisses me off the most. You look at me, Remind me again what your name is.",Client,anger,undefined
"On the contrary, I think I'm coming from somewhere that I think you know very well.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's why I'm dwelling on this point...,Client,anger,undefined
What point?,Client,anger,undefined
Your anger.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
My anger over...,Client,anger,undefined
You're trying to make me angry. You're provoking me.,Client,anger,undefined
"No, I'm suggesting that you already were angry before you came in.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were so angry you were considering not coming here at all.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you expressed that anger by coming late.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Fuck, I can't win here. You're...",Client,anger,undefined
I'm what?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I was gonna tell you the conclusions I reached but you're not interested, are you?",Client,anger,undefined
"You'd prefer to bait me, to piss me off, to... But the truth is, I'm the opposite of angry.",Client,anger,undefined
Anti-angry.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Fuck you, Paul!",Client,anger,undefined
"When you said you didn't want me, my first instinct was to tell you,",Client,anger,undefined
Who cares? I don't want this. I won't come.,Client,anger,undefined
"But then I realised that it's not your fault, it's my fault.",Client,anger,undefined
You don't owe me anything. You don't have to love me in return.,Client,anger,undefined
"All right, I realise that I may have",Therapist,neutral,Approval
slammed the door too loudly in your face.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Maybe I was a little...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Cruel?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I don't think I was cruel. I was resolved.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Oh.,Client,neutral,undefined
You demanded an unequivocal answer and I gave you one.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't apologise for giving you that answer.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
(Sighs),Client,depression,undefined
I am sorry that I hurt you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
OK.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So, a) I accept your apology...",Client,neutral,undefined
"and b) I think your answer last time wasn't so unequivocal,",Client,neutral,undefined
and c) I think my excuse for coming late was perfect.,Client,neutral,undefined
The excuse may have been perfect but the timing wasn't coincidental.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
(Laughs),Client,joy,undefined
Now I see why they laugh at shrinks and all their bullshit.,Client,disgust,undefined
What do you really mean? What does that mean? It's bullshit.,Client,disgust,undefined
Annoying bullshit.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Wouldn't it annoy you if your therapist forced you to accept a ridiculous interpretation,",Client,anger,undefined
and you couldn't defend yourself because you're the patient?,Client,anger,undefined
Everything you say will be held against you.,Client,anger,undefined
I should've stayed with that dog. I should've taken it to the vet instead of coming here.,Client,anger,undefined
"Here, where you're not being adequately treated maybe?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"What do you want from me, Paul? I mean, you refuse to listen to me.",Client,anger,undefined
I don't think you're listening to yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you're identifying with the dog.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That dog deserves more than being co-opted as some idiotic interpretation.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You wanna explore some theory, well, then at least make up something original.",Client,anger,undefined
"Jesus, make an effort!",Client,anger,undefined
You think I don't make an effort?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you think I don't try hard enough in therapy? Is that what you think?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That I sit here like a parasite who feeds off your stories, and your reality, and your pain?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe I'm not helping you at all.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Wow.,Client,neutral,undefined
All of a sudden I miss Andrew.,Client,sadness,undefined
"For the first time I'm sitting here facing you, and I miss him.",Client,sadness,undefined
So strange to miss Andrew.,Client,sadness,undefined
Andrew who loves me...,Client,sadness,undefined
"who admits it, who shouts it out in public.",Client,sadness,undefined
What if I did that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Have you ever imagined that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, no, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
Uh-uh.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've stopped fantasising.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've kicked the habit. It's hazardous to my health.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm getting married in a few months.,Client,neutral,undefined
I need to conserve every last drop of energy for my wedding.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're finding it requires energy that you don't have?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I thought brides were supposed to be whirling dervishes of activity.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
(Both chuckle),Client,joy,undefined
"Oh, my God!",Client,neutral,undefined
Just the word bride creeps me out.,Client,neutral,undefined
I told Andrew to pick a caterer and location without me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, well,",Client,neutral,undefined
what difference does it make if you get married at the Hilton or the Hyatt? It's all the same.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You try hard to be different, you still end up looking like everybody else. Even worse.",Client,neutral,undefined
"God, I wish I could just get married in Vegas.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No caterers, no guests,",Client,neutral,undefined
just an alcoholic justice of the peace and a transvestite organ player.,Client,neutral,undefined
(Laughs),Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
You know what he did? Andrew?,Client,joy,undefined
"He sent an email to everyone in his address book. I mean, everyone.",Client,joy,undefined
"His insurance agent, his mechanic.",Client,joy,undefined
"We had an exterminator over a couple of months ago, even he got an email.",Client,joy,undefined
He's told everybody. I haven't even told my father.,Client,joy,undefined
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I haven't had time... I mean, you know...",Client,neutral,undefined
Been busy and... I didn't want to tell him over the phone.,Client,neutral,undefined
Andrew suggested that we both go and tell him together but...,Client,neutral,undefined
"something happened, and we didn't get around to it.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Besides, I don't want us to both go in there hand in hand, all lovey-dovey, like the movies,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Guess what, Daddy!",Client,neutral,undefined
"So it's not exactly that it didn't work out, you've just... you've avoided telling him.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He hasn't been feeling well lately.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's had all these tests done. Of course I take him.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He doesn't know what questions to ask,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and he thinks as I am a doctor, they'll be more straight up with me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And to be honest, it'd be much nicer to be in the dark, not know the truth.",Client,neutral,undefined
"It could be positive, encouraging, optimistic. He has an MRI today.",Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe the news of you and Andrew would come as a welcome distraction to him.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Make him happy. Yeah?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, that's the problem.",Client,neutral,undefined
What is the problem?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, it'll give him something to look forward to.",Client,joy,undefined
"You mean, if you tell him, it'll be real.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, I guess so.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, I don't know, maybe...",Client,neutral,undefined
I know Andrew's been so happy these days. I feel like I'm cheating him.,Client,neutral,undefined
How?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Just by being sad.,Client,depression,undefined
Not sad exactly but not happy either.,Client,depression,undefined
"Neutral, indifferent.",Client,depression,undefined
"Andrew made us do the rounds last week, see all our friends, tell them the good news.",Client,depression,undefined
And I just feel like...,Client,depression,undefined
Did you ever see the movie King Kong?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You know how they capture him from the wild and bring him back to civilisation,",Client,neutral,undefined
and put him on display for the whole world to see.,Client,neutral,undefined
But he wasn't indifferent.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He was angry if I remember.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Whatever. It's a freak show.,Client,neutral,undefined
I feel like a freak show.,Client,neutral,undefined
Everyone's looking at me with these fake smiles plastered over their face.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just... It's like they're all waiting to see what I do next.,Client,neutral,undefined
Mm.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Laura, we don't really have, erm, we don't have that much time left.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Come on, I just got here.",Client,neutral,undefined
You were half an hour late.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
We're back to that again. That bullshit about me being late.,Client,depression,undefined
I know you don't think it's important. I do.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I give up. It's pointless.,Client,depression,undefined
You might as well just bind and gag me,Client,depression,undefined
because whatever I say or do doesn't make a difference.,Client,depression,undefined
"Maybe that's what you'd like to do, shut me up.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, I would.",Client,anger,undefined
"Cos you keep saying the same thing. I hear you, Paul. You want to kick me out of therapy.",Client,anger,undefined
"No, I don't want to kick you out. Absolutely not.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
(Clears throat) I do think that we should allow the possibility into the room.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
The possibility of us winding down our therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Believe me, you let it in.",Client,depression,undefined
How long have you been thinking about this?,Client,depression,undefined
Have you been thinking about getting rid of me for a long time?,Client,depression,undefined
"It looks to me like you've been waiting for this to happen, hoping this would happen.",Client,anger,undefined
My being late today is the perfect excuse to get rid of me.,Client,anger,undefined
"First of all, I'm not getting rid of you, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I'm just asking you to consider whether this therapy is really helping.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Oh, so now you're trying to soften the blow. Thank you, don't bother.",Client,anger,undefined
"Secondly, I think that you tossed me out a long time ago.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You don't want me to treat you as a psychologist.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You want me to treat you as somebody who's in love with you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And in my opinion, that is ruining any chance of this therapy being truly productive.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Let's face it. I have not been your therapist for a very long time, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I'm the one who says no to you. I'm the one who humiliates you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I've been humiliating you for the last year by not responding to you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"My honest opinion is that it is really difficult to continue therapy this way,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
from such an emotionally charged place.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Therapy should not be a source of constant humiliation for you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You really deserve more.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"What, you're not a good enough therapist all of a sudden?",Client,joy,undefined
"Am I the first patient to be in love with you, Paul?",Client,anger,undefined
You've been a therapist for 20 years. Don't you know what to do in these cases?,Client,anger,undefined
"For Christ sakes, just deal with it.",Client,anger,undefined
Maybe you can't treat me because you're in love with me too.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I... I can't treat you, Laura, because the boundaries have been breached too often.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
You've breached them by telling me that you no longer want to be my patient.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
So fucking what?,Client,anger,undefined
"What, our time is up?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, I'm afraid it is.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Couldn't you give me extra time?,Client,neutral,undefined
"There was this little dog, remember?",Client,joy,undefined
"I'm afraid I can't, Laura. It's, erm...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Come on, ten minutes.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I have to be somewhere else, I'm sorry.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Erm, it's the end of the month.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"I, erm...",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I presume you will need a... a receipt. I've done out an invoice.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I've billed you for the...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
(Door opens),Client,anger,undefined
Check this out.,Client,neutral,undefined
Your coffee...,Client,neutral,undefined
was horrifying.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't want to hurt your feelings.,Client,neutral,undefined
I won't tell you the truth about your coffee and what it says about you.,Client,neutral,undefined
What does it say about me?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I may tell you later.,Client,neutral,undefined
How do you like your coffee machine?,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's, uh, really nice.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But I, um... I can't accept it.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm... I'm sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"What, are you a government employee?",Client,neutral,undefined
"hey, I got this for an amazing price in an auction.",Client,joy,undefined
In a what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
An auction.,Client,joy,undefined
On the internet... Ebay.,Client,joy,undefined
I pick the times when the whole country's glued to the television.,Client,joy,undefined
"Prices drop 70%, 80%. Like...",Client,joy,undefined
"eight speakers and a receiver for only $1,000.",Client,joy,undefined
"Would've cost $4,500 retail.",Client,joy,undefined
"Anyway, thursday...",Client,joy,undefined
was the <i>American Idol</i> finale...,Client,joy,undefined
And I thought of you.,Client,joy,undefined
So I went online and grabbed this.,Client,joy,undefined
"Could you turn that off, please?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Just switch it off, please.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What are you afraid of? What's the big deal?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's a coffee machine.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, I think it's a really",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"sweet gesture, and I... I thank you.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Don't you want to upgrade the standard of living around here?,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I know you only drink tea, but what about your poor patients?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Um, no offense, but...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
don't you feel there's something aggressive in what you're doing here?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you haven't even asked me,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"if it's something that I want, if it's okay with me.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Okay, fine.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's just a stupid machine. Jeez.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm just trying to understand what you wanted to say with this.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Nothing.,Client,neutral,undefined
"What do you think? That by me bringing this to you that I'm,",Client,neutral,undefined
"what, trying to buy you?",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why is it important for me to have a coffee machine?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe because the coffee that it makes is top quality.,Client,neutral,undefined
I come here once a week for the time being,Client,neutral,undefined
and I need coffee here more than anywhere else,Client,neutral,undefined
to open up and all that crap.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I brought the machine with me and...,Client,neutral,undefined
Six different kinds of beans from the...,Client,neutral,undefined
totally bitter gourmet Guatemala...,Client,neutral,undefined
To the kind that postal pilots drink...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Jungle java, which is sickeningly sweet.",Client,neutral,undefined
You know what? I've got an idea: deduct it from what I owe you.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't think so.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
Could you be mad at me for something else altogether?,Client,neutral,undefined
Like what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I met a patient of yours.,Client,neutral,undefined
You met a patient of mine?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yesterday.,Client,neutral,undefined
I got the days wrong and I accidentally met Laura.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I gather it's a delicate situation when patients meet, yeah?",Client,neutral,undefined
What do you mean a delicate situation?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I don't know. I thought you therapists had some kind of...",Client,neutral,undefined
ethical code.,Client,neutral,undefined
Like I tell you intimate details about her...,Client,neutral,undefined
Things she may not want her therapist to know about her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I leave, she walks in and tells you the same kind of information about me.",Client,neutral,undefined
Could that be considered a breach in your ethical code?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't think there's any ethical problems, no.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Of course I'm not allowed to discuss other patients,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
but you are free to talk about what's happening in your life and...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
What's happening between you and Laura like...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Like anything else.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Okay, but... what's happening between me and Laura",Client,neutral,undefined
wouldn't have happened if we weren't patients of yours.,Client,neutral,undefined
I met her right out front here.,Client,neutral,undefined
That probably wouldn't have happened anywhere else on the planet.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you believe there's kind of a unique significance to...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
the fact that you met a patient of mine? What do you think it is?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm asking you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I think we've started therapy, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
You brought me a coffee machine,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because you intend to come here more often,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and you want to feel at home.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Through Laura, you're trying to relate that message to me.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She's your patient and I am too.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So we are...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
officially in therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"About the coffee machine, let's do this...",Client,neutral,undefined
Let's just say it's here on loan.,Client,neutral,undefined
"As long as I keep coming here, it's here.",Client,neutral,undefined
"When it's over, I'll take it with me.",Client,neutral,undefined
Deal?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay. I guess, um...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I... I would like some...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Some time to think it over, though, but it's okay.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Think positive.,Client,joy,undefined
"If I remember correctly, your wife",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
doesn't allow you to drink coffee at home.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
That's correct.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you feel,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that this is a place where you can say and do things,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that you might not be allowed to do at home?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, that issue's solved.",Client,neutral,undefined
Thanks to you.,Client,neutral,undefined
I left home.,Client,joy,undefined
"You really helped me with that in our last session,",Client,neutral,undefined
Showed me that leaving home was my own personal decision.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hey, doc, I'm serious.",Client,joy,undefined
You really did help me.,Client,joy,undefined
I left here much more determined than when I arrived...,Client,neutral,undefined
to carry out this disengagement.,Client,neutral,undefined
I went straight home and told Michaela I wanted to leave home.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I said it in the same way,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd tell her I was going to take the car to the garage.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And is that what you really felt,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
that it was,Therapist,neutral,Open question
so trivial?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, that's what I felt. Absolutely.",Client,neutral,undefined
And here's how it happened.,Client,neutral,undefined
Michaela was making salmon... It's always salmon on tuesdays...,Client,neutral,undefined
And I told her I wanted to leave home.,Client,joy,undefined
"Let me tell you, she didn't even turn her head away from the stove.",Client,joy,undefined
She just said that...,Client,neutral,undefined
I could've guessed this would happen.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And you never surprise me, Alex. Not even now.",Client,neutral,undefined
How did you feel about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Were you...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Were you... hurt by that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She wasn't trying to hurt me.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's just the way she is and...,Client,neutral,undefined
"I may have done her wrong last week, the way I presented her.",Client,depression,undefined
"But you've gotta understand, she's a superintelligent woman.",Client,depression,undefined
"When she was 22, she was already working on her PHD at Georgetown,",Client,depression,undefined
"so if she says she was expecting it, then I've gotta believe...",Client,depression,undefined
she saw me going through something,Client,depression,undefined
since the bombing and the heart attack,Client,depression,undefined
and the suspension from the force.,Client,depression,undefined
She saw much more than I was willing to show.,Client,depression,undefined
And realized that it could result in us separating.,Client,depression,undefined
You know what's interesting is that you're talking today,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
about your wife like...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know, she was some mythical",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
superwoman that's able to anticipate,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
everything 10 steps in advance.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"As far as intelligence goes, absolutely.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Really, no matter what else you say about her, she's got the brains",Client,neutral,undefined
of a rocket scientist on the Manhattan project.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Still, wasn't there something",Therapist,neutral,Open question
in her reaction that disappointed you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, you come home, you drop this bombshell and...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
she's indifferent to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, but that isn't the case here.",Client,neutral,undefined
We're not one of those couples that creates drama all the time.,Client,neutral,undefined
"On the contrary, we could've dragged this on for years",Client,neutral,undefined
"just for the sake of the kids, as they say.",Client,neutral,undefined
Have you told the kids yet?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, not yet.",Client,depression,undefined
"Now Roy, my eldest, he's been locked up in his room for days",Client,depression,undefined
doing some kind of chess championship on the internet.,Client,depression,undefined
"And Noelle, my daughter, she's on some kind of school trip.",Client,depression,undefined
But you will have to tell them at some time.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Of course.,Client,depression,undefined
Someday they'll have to accept the fact that their father,Client,depression,undefined
left home to look for a new life.,Client,depression,undefined
They can't understand that at their age.,Client,depression,undefined
How do you think they'll feel about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Roy will understand me.,Client,neutral,undefined
For sure.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's a very special boy. he has...,Client,neutral,undefined
inner truth.,Client,neutral,undefined
You know...,Client,depression,undefined
Roy's 11 years old.,Client,depression,undefined
And he hardly ever leaves the house.,Client,depression,undefined
He just sits at home and he sits by the computer,Client,depression,undefined
and plays chess and...,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, he just... No girlfriends,",Client,depression,undefined
"no buddies, no basketball.",Client,depression,undefined
"And at first it drove me crazy, 'cause he just seemed so miserable,",Client,depression,undefined
"so lonely,",Client,depression,undefined
unpopular.,Client,depression,undefined
I tried everything. I...,Client,depression,undefined
I organized tours at the air force museum for all the kids.,Client,depression,undefined
"They could come and sit in the cockpit of a real F-16,",Client,depression,undefined
play with the simulators and...,Client,depression,undefined
"It was no use. I mean, those tours, he'd walk around all alone.",Client,depression,undefined
The only one near him was like some...,Client,depression,undefined
"I don't know, some ugly leper kid all the kids were afraid to get next to.",Client,depression,undefined
"It's kind of hard to see that, isn't it?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Sometimes it's harder for us as parents to see our kid lonely,Therapist,neutral,Approval
than it is for the kid himself.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It took me a long time to realize that.,Client,depression,undefined
Then I realized that...,Client,depression,undefined
he was happy.,Client,neutral,undefined
That I had the problem.,Client,neutral,undefined
That I...,Client,depression,undefined
I couldn't accept the fact that he wasn't popular.,Client,depression,undefined
"That he's an outsider, and that's okay. It's just his personality.",Client,depression,undefined
I used to give him and michaela such a hard time.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'd call the counselor, I'd call the teachers,",Client,depression,undefined
"and everybody said, There's no problem.",Client,depression,undefined
The boy feels good about himself.,Client,depression,undefined
It's just the way it is.,Client,neutral,undefined
Was it hard for you to accept?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, but, you know, today...",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm jealous of him,",Client,joy,undefined
Cause he doesn't need anybody. He's got his own world.,Client,joy,undefined
He's got his movies and books and computer games,Client,joy,undefined
and chess. And the kid was born without a competitive bone in his body.,Client,joy,undefined
"Even the chess stuff, it's not about winning.",Client,neutral,undefined
He doesn't care if he wins. He just likes the thinking it requires.,Client,neutral,undefined
A few years ago I tried to organize this ping-pong tournament,Client,neutral,undefined
for his... for his class in the backyard.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He turns to me and he says, Dad, don't you feel sorry for these kids?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Only one will win, and it's probably Robert.",Client,neutral,undefined
And the rest will look pathetic in front of the girls.,Client,neutral,undefined
haha..,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
Don't you feel sorry for them?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I swear, I don't know where he got those genes.",Client,joy,undefined
Certainly not from me.,Client,joy,undefined
You think he's too good to be connected to your genes?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Are you making fun of me?,Client,neutral,undefined
I want you to listen,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to what you're saying about yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
This boy is your own flesh and blood. You... you love him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Dearly.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're very proud of his beautiful qualities,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and yet you think,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, he's the exact opposite of me.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He couldn't possibly be connected to me.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Please, let's not get into that again. No.",Client,depression,undefined
"This is completely a genetic issue. Look, he got",Client,depression,undefined
the female genes from Michaela and my mother.,Client,depression,undefined
She saved his life.,Client,depression,undefined
By that I mean at...,Client,depression,undefined
At the march on Washington... In '63.,Client,depression,undefined
"Right before King's big speech, Mahalia Mackson sang that song",Client,depression,undefined
<i>I been 'buked and I been scorned</i>.,Client,depression,undefined
And they caught eyes,Client,depression,undefined
"in the crowd, and...",Client,depression,undefined
They both had tears flowing down their faces.,Client,depression,undefined
And they felt connected.,Client,depression,undefined
"My father was this lonely angry man,",Client,disgust,undefined
and she...,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, she melted him.",Client,neutral,undefined
She was the only person he ever trusted.,Client,neutral,undefined
He was at war with the rest of the world.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And the war ain't over, believe me.",Client,neutral,undefined
And still he...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He cheated on her.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Constantly.,Client,disgust,undefined
The guy just wanted more and more.,Client,disgust,undefined
All the time.,Client,disgust,undefined
But he didn't leave her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, what are you crazy? Why would he leave her? He loved her.",Client,joy,undefined
You're sure about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are you sure that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it wasn't just that he held her in very high esteem and that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
he was really grateful,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for everything that she'd done for him throughout his life?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to justify him? He could've left her.,Client,depression,undefined
Why make her life miserable?,Client,depression,undefined
"Okay, And you, unlike him,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're trying to do the right thing?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're leaving home just like that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're not dragging out things like he did.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Okay. All right, all right.",Client,neutral,undefined
I see you believe in the whole theory that,Client,neutral,undefined
children try to rectify what their parents did wrong.,Client,neutral,undefined
All right. Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
Perhaps you might not have loved Michaela because,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you admired her so much for being so perfect.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Wait. Why are we still talking about Michaela?,Client,anger,undefined
That story is over.,Client,anger,undefined
Because I'm not sure that your leaving her is really the solution,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to how you feel about yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I see you believe in the whole theory that,Client,neutral,undefined
children try to rectify what their parents did wrong.,Client,neutral,undefined
All right. Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know that it's about rectification.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think it's more what we call a pattern.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
We unconsciously repeat patterns that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
we have witnessed in childhood.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you said I was trying to rectify what my father did.,Client,depression,undefined
"I think you're presenting it that way, but on a deeper level...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think there may be more similarity,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
between you and your father's view of marriage.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't know what you mean.,Client,depression,undefined
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You can't see any way in which,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you and your father may have married the same kind of woman?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It seems to me that you both married women,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"whom you admire, but...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you don't necessarily love.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's some bullshit. You actually buy this shit?,Client,disgust,undefined
That I'm repeating my father's mistakes?,Client,disgust,undefined
Let me tell you something:,Client,depression,undefined
"what's going on in my marriage has got nothing to do with my father,",Client,depression,undefined
so stop comparing us.,Client,depression,undefined
I wanna go back to Laura for a minute.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why is it so important to go back to Laura?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is it because she's my patient and you think,Therapist,neutral,Open question
it might bother me that you met?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't get this.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why can't I talk about her?,Client,neutral,undefined
What is the big deal about meeting her?,Client,neutral,undefined
You won't believe how much this cost.,Client,neutral,undefined
$450. I mean...,Client,neutral,undefined
"That's crazy, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
Too bad they don't sell property on the online auctions.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, now that Michaela has the house,",Client,neutral,undefined
"during the Indy 500 or something, I could go on",Client,neutral,undefined
get a place in the same neighborhood for almost half a million bucks.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You got the deal of your life here, doc.",Client,neutral,undefined
Someone who doesn't know about the whole tv factor,Client,neutral,undefined
"would've paid $1,500 for it, minimum. so if I'm here for a year,",Client,neutral,undefined
then that means you're renting it for... $8 a week.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Could we get back to our therapy session, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Okay. Well, Laura couldn't get over it.",Client,joy,undefined
I showed her the machine and she just...,Client,joy,undefined
she couldn't believe it.,Client,joy,undefined
Would you like to...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Would you like to tell me how you two met?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Sure.,Client,neutral,undefined
I lost track of time.,Client,neutral,undefined
I moved in with my gay friend Daniel,Client,neutral,undefined
and his little boyfriend. I told you about them.,Client,neutral,undefined
And they are real happy I left home.,Client,joy,undefined
They bring their friends over to meet me and they've turned me,Client,joy,undefined
into the talk of the gay community.,Client,joy,undefined
"So I've been going along with it. you know, I go to dinners, drinks.",Client,joy,undefined
I even went to this gay club with them on sunday.,Client,joy,undefined
"They told me there'd be some hot ladies there,",Client,joy,undefined
somebody I could pick up that aren't even lesbians.,Client,joy,undefined
And it didn't do anything for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
What it did was make me lose track of time.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was up all night long,",Client,neutral,undefined
"so I could've sworn yesterday was tuesday,",Client,neutral,undefined
so I came here. but when I got here I saw Laura leaving.,Client,neutral,undefined
I walked up to her and I asked her if everything was okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She said everything wasn't okay,",Client,neutral,undefined
"that she ran over a dog, or almost ran over this dog yesterday morning.",Client,neutral,undefined
"The way she described it, it sounded like this...",Client,neutral,undefined
the airedale terrier pedigree.,Client,neutral,undefined
The airedale terrier is the only dog in history,Client,neutral,undefined
to be knighted by the king of England for bravery in battle.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you know that?,Client,joy,undefined
"I didn't know that, no.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah well, it did. It's an amazing story.",Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, this dog...",Client,joy,undefined
"Okay, well, maybe next time.",Client,neutral,undefined
I asked her if she had been leaving a session,Client,neutral,undefined
with you.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she was a bit taken aback like I had caught her in something shameful.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hell, I thought only Navy pilots felt that way about seeing a shrink.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, I admitted to her that I was seeing you also.",Client,neutral,undefined
And I realized that I was here a day early.,Client,neutral,undefined
She thought that was just hilarious.,Client,joy,undefined
That someone could get the days mixed up.,Client,joy,undefined
And she's got this...,Client,joy,undefined
"I don't know, she's got this way of looking at you.",Client,neutral,undefined
"It's like this girl, she's got... There's something fierce about her.",Client,neutral,undefined
Right?,Client,neutral,undefined
What do you mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. She's got this look. It's like...,Client,neutral,undefined
It's like she's used to getting her own way.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you know what she said?,Client,joy,undefined
She said that you,Client,joy,undefined
could ruin even a cup of Lipton tea.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, come on.",Client,joy,undefined
"So I guess you're both in the same... In the same boat, so to speak.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Totally.,Client,joy,undefined
"Anyway, so we got in my car and we...",Client,joy,undefined
"drove to the accident site. naturally, there wasn't any dog there,",Client,joy,undefined
so we grabbed a cup of coffee and I...,Client,neutral,undefined
sketched the area on a napkin.,Client,neutral,undefined
At her place?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, why would you say that? No, some cafe.",Client,neutral,undefined
So I drew her an overhead view of the area.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm a genius at that, you know, the yards and the green areas...",Client,neutral,undefined
anywhere where a dog might make himself disappear.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sounds like a real military operation.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"To be honest, I kind of miss that,",Client,neutral,undefined
"just being up in the air,",Client,neutral,undefined
"reducing the area on a map,",Client,neutral,undefined
looking for a man intelligence has been after for 3 months.,Client,neutral,undefined
So did you find the dog?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, it probably went and died somewhere.",Client,neutral,undefined
But you could say it still had a happy ending.,Client,joy,undefined
"Hey, is... Is our time almost up?",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, we have about... We have about five minutes.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Oh, sorry. I thought this thing was off.",Client,neutral,undefined
Speak of the devil.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm supposed to meet Laura. Do you mind if I take this?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sure, go ahead.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah, hey. What's up?",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, not yet, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
"But judging from paul's face, he'll kick me out of here in a minute or 2.",Client,neutral,undefined
I know. Right.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, all right. Bye.",Client,neutral,undefined
So what do you think?,Client,neutral,undefined
Should I go for her? Laura?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, co... Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Come on, you can tell me. I know it's not ethical, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
you're my shrink too.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's the first woman I've been out with in 15 years.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't want to have a lousy experience.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm sorry, I can't give you that kind of advice, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"But she's... she's the kind of woman that,",Client,joy,undefined
"you know, could drive a man insane. am I right?",Client,joy,undefined
Paul. just man to man. Give me a little tip.,Client,neutral,undefined
I can't do that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
This could affect my whole life.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I can't give you dating tips, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
: Sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Just stop it.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"That's all right, 'cause I'm used to you not giving me advice anyway.",Client,neutral,undefined
"But, you know, you always help out in the end.",Client,neutral,undefined
In your crazy roundabout kind of way.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And when she's here for her session,",Client,neutral,undefined
try to pull the espresso handle fast...,Client,neutral,undefined
'Cause she likes it with a lot of foam.,Client,neutral,undefined
"My mother, she was the same way.",Client,neutral,undefined
"There was selflessness in everything she did, just like Michaela.",Client,neutral,undefined
She never felt like she was missing out on something somewhere else.,Client,neutral,undefined
She didn't care if she was fulfilling herself and all that shit.,Client,neutral,undefined
There was...,Client,neutral,undefined
"There was something pure about her,",Client,neutral,undefined
"wholesome... like Roy. No, he got that from her.",Client,neutral,undefined
So the women in your family are...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"they're pure and wholesome, unblemished.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And that the men are somehow,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"the opposite... dirty,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
in conflict with themselves.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's not a bad description of my father...,Client,neutral,undefined
Dirty as hell.,Client,neutral,undefined
I found something for you.,Client,neutral,undefined
I thought you should have it.,Client,neutral,undefined
In here?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah, in the front pocket.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's for your collection.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's a catboat.,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
It's beautiful.,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
Thank you.,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
It's a going-away present.,Client,neutral,undefined
"This is our last session, right? You said three.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I said",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
at least three.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
If you're totally sick of listening,Client,neutral,undefined
"to other people's insipid lives,",Client,neutral,undefined
Then maybe you can look at it,Client,neutral,undefined
And it will make you feel like you're somewhere else.,Client,neutral,undefined
Insipid-- That's a good word.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I read thesauruses for fun.,Client,joy,undefined
"I'm not a freak, okay? I just like words.",Client,joy,undefined
I thought you could use it.,Client,neutral,undefined
It must really suck having to listen,Client,neutral,undefined
To other people's problems all day.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So does that chair, like,",Client,joy,undefined
enhance your brain function?,Client,joy,undefined
i don't think so.,Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
Can you read minds?,Client,joy,undefined
"Unfortunately, no.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, it would be a lot easier if you could.",Client,joy,undefined
It would.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Can I try the chair?,Client,joy,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Please.,Client,joy,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How are you? You look tired.,Client,joy,undefined
I'm okay.,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
Maybe you should take a nap.,Client,joy,undefined
Maybe.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I've noticed that, uh, Cy's drawing is--",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Is gone.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Did you erase it?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Yes.,Client,joy,undefined
How do you feel about that?,Client,joy,undefined
How do you think I feel?,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe a little scared,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because this could be our,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
final session?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why would I be scared?,Client,neutral,undefined
Is the evaluation going to be bad?,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't think it's the evaluation,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that scares you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I think it's the possibility that um,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you won't be coming back.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Sorry, but no.",Client,joy,undefined
I bought you a goodbye present.,Client,joy,undefined
See ya.,Client,joy,undefined
"I know it's a goodbye present,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But there's another way to look at it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you want to leave something behind,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So that I won't forget you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You said you liked the boat.,Client,neutral,undefined
I do.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"If you don't want it, i'll take it back.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you want to take it back?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
So...,Client,neutral,undefined
"if someone my age wants to start therapy,",Client,neutral,undefined
How would it work?,Client,neutral,undefined
"if someone my age wants to start therapy,",Client,neutral,undefined
How would it work?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, we'd take it at that person's own pace,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Not like these last few sessions--,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"The evaluation, the three-Session deadline--",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Nothing like that.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"See, the person who's in therapy",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"controls the gas,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"So to speak,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
And the wheel for that matter.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
So it's like driving a car?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, it's a bit like driving a car.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So...,Client,neutral,undefined
pretend i'm in therapy now.,Client,neutral,undefined
All right.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I said pretend.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So,",Client,neutral,undefined
what do I do?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why don't you tell me a little bit more about the boat?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I got it years ago,Client,neutral,undefined
from a homeless woman in New York,Client,neutral,undefined
when I was just a kid.,Client,neutral,undefined
What were you doing in New York?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We were on a family vacation.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Why do you say that, family vacation?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because it wasn't a real vacation,Client,depression,undefined
and we weren't a real family.,Client,depression,undefined
"No sand, no ocean--",Client,depression,undefined
"That's not a vacation, you know.",Client,depression,undefined
That's bullshit.,Client,depression,undefined
My dad took me to central park.,Client,depression,undefined
There was this old woman,Client,depression,undefined
right at the park's entrance,Client,depression,undefined
Selling these little wooden toys.,Client,depression,undefined
She looked so miserable.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I remember thinking,",Client,depression,undefined
it's worse for her.,Client,depression,undefined
I had just enough money left from my allowance,Client,depression,undefined
To buy the boat.,Client,depression,undefined
"By the time we came home, it was over.",Client,depression,undefined
What was over?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Their marriage.,Client,depression,undefined
"Actually, I think it was over",Client,depression,undefined
"during the vacation but they were, like,",Client,depression,undefined
pretending or something.,Client,depression,undefined
"I went to school,",Client,depression,undefined
i went to practice,Client,depression,undefined
And I came home,Client,depression,undefined
"and they were waiting for me in the kitchen,",Client,depression,undefined
Smiling like those movie stars.,Client,depression,undefined
Like,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
movie stars?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You know, those smiles that movie stars do?",Client,depression,undefined
Those big smiles,Client,depression,undefined
but their eyes are all glazed over.,Client,depression,undefined
Like--,Client,depression,undefined
And then my mother starts to cry.,Client,depression,undefined
Then my father says to her in this voice...,Client,depression,undefined
"Olivia, leave it to me.",Client,depression,undefined
And then he starts to cry.,Client,depression,undefined
And i'm just standing there,Client,depression,undefined
stuck in the kitchen,Client,depression,undefined
Hungry as fuck with these two babies.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't remember the day he actually left.,Client,disgust,undefined
I just remember that day in the kitchen.,Client,disgust,undefined
Where did he go?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Back to New York,Client,disgust,undefined
With his new wife.,Client,disgust,undefined
And I stayed here with my mother,Client,disgust,undefined
Who's totally depressed.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Cy and Darlene-- They lived close by,",Client,depression,undefined
"So,",Client,depression,undefined
they helped me get to practice and back.,Client,depression,undefined
They didn't want me to give it up.,Client,depression,undefined
Why are you looking at me like that?,Client,depression,undefined
"It's just the way you talk about it,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Like you're not so upset about the breakup,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
As,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the way they did it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe that's what's making you sad.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm not sad.,Client,depression,undefined
Is that what people are,Client,depression,undefined
supposed to do in therapy?,Client,depression,undefined
Sit around and whine over all their problems?,Client,depression,undefined
It's never going to happen.,Client,depression,undefined
That's what she would do.,Client,depression,undefined
I am nothing like her--,Client,depression,undefined
Your mom?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Where was your dad while all this was going on?,Client,disgust,undefined
"I told you, in New York",Client,disgust,undefined
with Natasha.,Client,disgust,undefined
Did you ever consider living with them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,depression,undefined
"We once thought maybe, but...",Client,depression,undefined
It didn't work out.,Client,depression,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They needed their space.,Client,depression,undefined
They didn't last anyway.,Client,depression,undefined
He wanted me to live with them.,Client,depression,undefined
"He was really pissed that she said no, so,",Client,depression,undefined
it really soured their relationship.,Client,depression,undefined
So you blame yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Whatever way the cookie crumbles,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
you're still to blame?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How old are you?,Client,joy,undefined
"What do you mean, how old am i?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
People really don't talk like that anymore.,Client,joy,undefined
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Your logic has,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"has some flaws, Sophie.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You aren't responsible,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for what your parents did.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You couldn't be.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Were you a gymnast before--,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Before you met Cy?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I don't remember a time before I met Cy.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've known him since I was so little.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Besides my father,",Client,neutral,undefined
They're the only people,Client,neutral,undefined
who ever believed in me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Cy discovered me gymnastically.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was dancing around on a log in the backyard,Client,neutral,undefined
To entertain Dana.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, doing spins and things.",Client,neutral,undefined
He put me on a beam the next day.,Client,neutral,undefined
Their house was like my house.,Client,neutral,undefined
I had a key.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Before my father left,",Client,depression,undefined
"When he and my mom were fighting all the time,",Client,depression,undefined
I slept over.,Client,depression,undefined
I had these really bad attacks back then.,Client,depression,undefined
My stomach would start to shake,Client,depression,undefined
And then my whole body would start to shake.,Client,depression,undefined
Sometimes i'd start throwing up,Client,depression,undefined
And I couldn't make it stop.,Client,depression,undefined
They took me to the emergency room one night.,Client,depression,undefined
We never told my parents.,Client,depression,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I ruined their family.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I did, I really did.",Client,disgust,undefined
Darlene was so good to me.,Client,disgust,undefined
I was--,Client,disgust,undefined
She really was good to me.,Client,disgust,undefined
She told me,Client,depression,undefined
before she left for Wisconsin,Client,depression,undefined
That she was only going,Client,depression,undefined
because she knew I would be there,Client,depression,undefined
To take care of Dana.,Client,depression,undefined
"She said she didn't trust Cy,",Client,disgust,undefined
but she trusted me.,Client,disgust,undefined
She trusted me and I ruined it.,Client,disgust,undefined
You're thinking he used me.,Client,depression,undefined
You're wrong.,Client,depression,undefined
He kept trying to stop me.,Client,depression,undefined
"He kept saying,",Client,depression,undefined
"Sophie, you don't know what you're doing.",Client,depression,undefined
We'll get to a place and,Client,depression,undefined
there'll be no turning back.,Client,depression,undefined
"He's a really good person, Cy is.",Client,depression,undefined
He's a gentleman.,Client,depression,undefined
"He kept saying,",Client,disgust,undefined
you don't know what you're doing.,Client,disgust,undefined
"But the thing is, I did.",Client,disgust,undefined
"And what were you doing, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"At first, I thought it was my imagination.",Client,depression,undefined
And then he stopped talking to me,Client,depression,undefined
while Darlene was home.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, like he was embarrassed,",Client,depression,undefined
Like he was hiding something.,Client,depression,undefined
And sometimes i'd catch him holding his breath,Client,depression,undefined
While he was looking at me.,Client,depression,undefined
"He loves me, I know he does.",Client,disgust,undefined
So I knew,Client,disgust,undefined
"even before Darlene went away,",Client,disgust,undefined
I knew that he loved me.,Client,disgust,undefined
And then she left for six months,Client,disgust,undefined
But Cy wouldn't have sex with me,Client,disgust,undefined
"Even though everyone assumed we were doing it,",Client,disgust,undefined
That we'd been doing it for months.,Client,disgust,undefined
Cy said it was a line that we absolutely,Client,depression,undefined
Positively would not cross.,Client,depression,undefined
We'd been sleeping in the same bed--,Client,depression,undefined
Just sleeping.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then one night,",Client,depression,undefined
"The night before Darlene came home,",Client,depression,undefined
I woke up in the middle of the night,Client,depression,undefined
And he was awake.,Client,depression,undefined
Then he--,Client,disgust,undefined
I--,Client,disgust,undefined
It happened.,Client,disgust,undefined
It felt like nothing at all.,Client,disgust,undefined
Like nothing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not good?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not bad?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Kind of like--,Client,sadness,undefined
Kind of like I was watching it happen...,Client,sadness,undefined
on a really small black and white television.,Client,sadness,undefined
Like,Client,sadness,undefined
i was checking my e-mail,Client,sadness,undefined
At the same time.,Client,sadness,undefined
Like I wasn't really there.,Client,sadness,undefined
I don't know.,Client,sadness,undefined
The next day we pretended,Client,disgust,undefined
like it hadn't happened.,Client,disgust,undefined
Then at practice that afternoon,Client,disgust,undefined
We had this big fight,Client,disgust,undefined
in front of everyone.,Client,disgust,undefined
Because of what happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I fell off the beam.,Client,depression,undefined
I'd been going for this back bend,Client,depression,undefined
And for some reason I thought the beam,Client,depression,undefined
Was longer than it really was,Client,depression,undefined
"So,",Client,depression,undefined
i bent right off of it.,Client,depression,undefined
I fell flat on my back.,Client,depression,undefined
I just stayed there,Client,sadness,undefined
"Trying to breathe,",Client,sadness,undefined
"Afraid to move,",Client,sadness,undefined
Afraid that i'd broken something.,Client,sadness,undefined
Then Cy came over and started screaming at me.,Client,sadness,undefined
We've got two days until this tournament,Client,sadness,undefined
And you've lost your focus.,Client,sadness,undefined
Now get back up there and do it right.,Client,sadness,undefined
That night I slept on the couch.,Client,sadness,undefined
Then in the middle of the night Cy came in,Client,sadness,undefined
And i thought that--,Client,sadness,undefined
But he wanted me to put Dana back to bed.,Client,sadness,undefined
She'd had a bad dream,Client,sadness,undefined
and come into his room looking for me.,Client,sadness,undefined
"So,",Client,sadness,undefined
I put her back to bed and then we talked.,Client,sadness,undefined
He kept talking about my potential.,Client,disgust,undefined
He said it would ruin,Client,disgust,undefined
both of our careers if this got out.,Client,disgust,undefined
He said we had to stop.,Client,disgust,undefined
That's it.,Client,disgust,undefined
"We almost had sex again that night,",Client,sadness,undefined
but he didn't want to.,Client,sadness,undefined
That's it.,Client,sadness,undefined
A few weeks later,Client,sadness,undefined
Darlene said she wanted to talk to me.,Client,sadness,undefined
She said that Dana had become too attached to me,Client,sadness,undefined
While she was in Wisconsin,Client,sadness,undefined
And I probably shouldn't come over for awhile.,Client,sadness,undefined
But it was pathetic,Client,sadness,undefined
"Because I know her, you know?",Client,sadness,undefined
She was lying to me.,Client,sadness,undefined
I couldn't look at her.,Client,sadness,undefined
I just said i'm sorry.,Client,sadness,undefined
"She said,",Client,sadness,undefined
don't be silly.,Client,sadness,undefined
Kids forget quickly.,Client,sadness,undefined
Grownups don't but kids do.,Client,sadness,undefined
Dana will forget you.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Dana will never forget you, Sophie.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You don't think so? No.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm sure of it.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Darlene,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

Grownups,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
can forget.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Children can't.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"When I left, darlene gave me a present",Client,sadness,undefined
That she got for me in Wisconsin.,Client,sadness,undefined
What was it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
An apron...,Client,depression,undefined
with cows on it.,Client,depression,undefined
She knows I like to cook and,Client,depression,undefined
"I collect things with cows on them, so,",Client,depression,undefined
it was sort of...,Client,depression,undefined
Perfect.,Client,depression,undefined
The accident...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
it happened that night?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I woke up in the ambulance.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you remember how you got there?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't even remember,Client,sadness,undefined
walking away from the house.,Client,sadness,undefined
I remember her giving me the apron.,Client,sadness,undefined
I didn't want it. I tried to give it back...,Client,sadness,undefined
"but she said,",Client,sadness,undefined
Take it so you don't get dirty.,Client,sadness,undefined
And then I think she kissed me.,Client,sadness,undefined
"It must've been at their door because,",Client,sadness,undefined
now I remember stepping back,Client,sadness,undefined
and seeing the whole house.,Client,sadness,undefined
What did you see?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I saw thhouse from the outside,",Client,sadness,undefined
That's all.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'll huff and i'll puff,Client,sadness,undefined
And i'll blow your house down.,Client,sadness,undefined
So what the fuck are you gonna write now?,Client,sadness,undefined
Are you asking me if I think,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
the accident was your fault?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yes.,Client,depression,undefined
When you came here this morning Sophie,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm so sorry. I don't know how that happened.,Client,depression,undefined
It's no problem. Don't worry about it.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm so sorry.,Client,depression,undefined
Don't worry about it.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills

I can clean it up later on. It doesn't matter.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I don't wanna fuck everything up here too.,Client,disgust,undefined
"No, don't worry about it.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
If you had to write the evaluation now--,Client,anger,undefined
But I don't have to write,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

How many times do I have to tell you?!,Client,anger,undefined
What does your instinct tell you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't have any instinct.,Client,anger,undefined
What does your heart tell you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't have a heart.,Client,anger,undefined

I think that you're having quite a difficult time,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Taking care of yourself recently.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
So?,Client,anger,undefined
So it doesn't mean that you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
deliberately ran into that car.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So what would you write?,Client,anger,undefined
"i don't know, something along the lines of...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
as a result of the anxiety,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"She felt preceding the incident,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"The subject may have been distracted,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Acted irresponsibly but,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
we cannot conclude,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That the accident was a,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"premeditated, willful act--",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That sounds really vague.,Client,anger,undefined
I can't be any more specific than that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm not a magician.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't know anything more,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

I fucking hate you!,Client,anger,undefined
You never say what you really mean.,Client,anger,undefined

A willful and irresponsible act?,Client,anger,undefined
Just say it--,Client,anger,undefined
She tried to kill herself or not.,Client,anger,undefined
"If you think I did, then say so!",Client,anger,undefined
What's the problem?,Client,anger,undefined
There's a difference,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Between not being careful,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because you feel vulnerable,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And wanting to commit suicide.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
No!,Client,anger,undefined
You don't see the difference?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No !,Client,anger,undefined
It's just like the picture frame.,Client,anger,undefined

"And then, she told me to deal with it.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Meaning, you know, this is my job.",Client,disgust,undefined
She's right.,Client,disgust,undefined
"She said, You are an experienced therapist, just deal with it.",Client,disgust,undefined
Are you surprised to the reaction? You put it on her and she threw it back.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How was I supposed...,Client,anger,undefined
You hammered me about this last week.,Client,anger,undefined
You went on and on about what I... I knew it was a bad idea.,Client,anger,undefined
"And now, I'm coming to you with this mess... And all you...",Client,anger,undefined
You're not an intern. Far from it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Don't play the intern.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"If you think something is a bad idea, you don't do it because I suggested it.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I said we should talk about it. You were furious.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Like I was trying to take Laura away from you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Two days later, you abruptly tried to stop her treatment.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You said that ending the therapy was the best good solution.,Client,anger,undefined
I said it might be necessary for her sake.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"When you say good solution, I think you mean a solution to your problems.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is that what I mean?,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm assuming you acted hastily,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because you thought it was necessary.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That it had to be dealt with quickly.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"What do you want, Gina? Do you want to...",Client,anger,undefined
What do you want to hear? Do you want me to talk about Laura?,Client,anger,undefined
Do you want us to have a Laura session?,Client,anger,undefined
"What do you want me to say, that I sit opposite her and say:",Client,anger,undefined
"Oh, what if?",Client,anger,undefined
"Well, I do.",Client,anger,undefined
You think I'm in denial about it?,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not.,Client,depression,undefined
Laura is...,Client,depression,undefined
She's attractive.,Client,depression,undefined
Anybody who is a therapist knows that...,Client,depression,undefined
"Look, I know all the ways in with her, all the doors I could open",Client,depression,undefined
if I wanted to...,Client,depression,undefined
Do you imagine opening them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yes I do.,Client,neutral,undefined
I fantasize,Client,neutral,undefined
about Laura.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, it's like a gynecologist.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's easier for women to believe that their male gynecologist,Client,neutral,undefined
doesn't have any sexual desire for them.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Of course, they want him to find their bodies attractive as well.",Client,neutral,undefined
Don't they?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Paul, Don't even try",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
to break down a relationship between a woman and her gynecologist.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
That's a deep end.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Anyway, last week, I...",Client,depression,undefined
I got this...,Client,depression,undefined
sharp... kind of pain...,Client,depression,undefined
"So I went to the urologist and, on Monday, and I thought:",Client,depression,undefined
This is...,Client,depression,undefined
This is really scary.,Client,depression,undefined
And then this random thought comes into my head,Client,depression,undefined
"because it's so cold in the room, and I think:",Client,depression,undefined
"My dick is shrinking, and I don't want the doctor to think that, you know,",Client,depression,undefined
that's the real size. Never mind... It was just...,Client,depression,undefined
"Paul, You know, there is no connection between a gynecologist office and...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the intimacy between therapist and patient.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm curious about What do you think the connection is?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What I'm saying is that...,Client,depression,undefined
"As a male therapist, sitting across from a beautiful patient, I...",Client,depression,undefined
I know exactly...,Client,depression,undefined
How to engage her.,Client,depression,undefined
I know exactly what it would take to...,Client,depression,undefined
To turn her on.,Client,depression,undefined
You know what turns her on?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, I do.",Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Any number of things.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I could manipulate her to do anything I wanted.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know that. And I doubt if it's only male therapist who have those thoughts.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you know what I'm talking about?,Client,neutral,undefined
"For example, if a male doctor performs an examination on a female patient,",Client,neutral,undefined
"there'd be a nurse present, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, that's for a reason.",Client,neutral,undefined
Am I the nurse?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I keep you from crossing the line. Is that why you came to me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Let me tell you what worries me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You have boundaries too,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and just like you, this woman knows how to cross them.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
All I'm saying is that the temptation is there for any therapist.,Client,depression,undefined
I know what I'm doing.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, if I were a gynecologist, and I were performing an examination,",Client,depression,undefined
I wouldn't accidentally start to...,Client,depression,undefined
Listen to yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You know, you say you have no problem discussing Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And then, I bring her up,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"and suddenly, it's... It's all about genitals.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Gynecologist, and urologist, and...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it seems to me that you're taking all of this,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to an extremely intimate realm.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you're saying to me...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I'm extremely vulnerable, here.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Help me here...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Where it hurts.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You know what?,Client,anger,undefined
What gets to me is that...,Client,anger,undefined
I lay it out for you.,Client,anger,undefined
All I want is for you to give me...,Client,anger,undefined
"the Gina treatment,,",Client,anger,undefined
"to get in there with your cold, analytical scalpel,",Client,anger,undefined
and get some perspective. Say:,Client,anger,undefined
"Try this, Paul, try that!",Client,anger,undefined
What I didn't expect was that...,Client,anger,undefined
"That you give up on me, telling me to find her",Client,anger,undefined
a new therapist.,Client,anger,undefined
Give up on you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You suggest a course of action. When that fails, you say to me:",Client,anger,undefined
"Hey, you did it, don't come blaming me.",Client,anger,undefined
Do you really believe I convinced you to do something destructive?,Therapist,anger,Structuring the therapy
Let's talk about that.,Therapist,anger,Structuring the therapy
"It seems like a distraction from talking about your feelings about her,",Therapist,anger,Structuring the therapy
"but okay, let's start by looking at how you're conducting her therapy,",Therapist,anger,Structuring the therapy
"which seems to me impulsive,",Therapist,anger,Structuring the therapy
"unorganized, and if I'm honest, very problematic.",Therapist,anger,Structuring the therapy
"Really, is it now?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Whenever I try to talk about this,",Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
you unleash all this aggression,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
to show me this area is off limits.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
"Touch this, I'll burn it down.",Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
"All right, we'll deal with it.",Client,neutral,undefined
Right... Right.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"You remember I was talking about Alex, the fighter pilot?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Paul, God, listen to yourself!",Therapist,anger,Communication Skills
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
"You say Let's talk about Laura, and then you bring up Alex,",Therapist,anger,Restatement
"or anything you can think of, so long as it's no Laura.",Therapist,anger,Restatement
This is about Laura.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Alex, the fighter pilot...",Client,neutral,undefined
met Laura.,Client,neutral,undefined
This is about Laura.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Alex, the fighter pilot...",Client,depression,undefined
met Laura.,Client,depression,undefined
How?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
After a session,Client,depression,undefined
we had this talk about stopping therapy.,Client,depression,undefined
The session ended and she wouldn't leave.,Client,depression,undefined
"She wanted extra time, I told her I couldn't, I had an appointment with...",Client,depression,undefined
urologist.,Client,depression,undefined
You didn't tell her that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No. I said I had an appointment.,Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, she stormed out, and lo and behold, who does she meet?",Client,disgust,undefined
He was there and you had a conflicting appointment?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"He was a day early by mistake, which is weird,",Client,disgust,undefined
because this guy is such a military perfectionist.,Client,disgust,undefined
A machine. He can probably tell the time by triangulating the stars,Client,disgust,undefined
"or something. Anyway, he forgot what day it was.",Client,disgust,undefined
"So he comes back the next afternoon, tells me that they met, and now...",Client,anger,undefined
They're dating.,Client,anger,undefined
You think it's funny?,Client,depression,undefined
Because I don't.,Client,depression,undefined
"No, It's not funny. It's curious, I guess.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What's so... What's curiously funny about it?,Client,anger,undefined
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Just give me a minute and let me figure out what I'm thinking....,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"It made me smile, I don't know why.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
They're dating.,Client,depression,undefined
Dating?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She went out with him to get back at me. I pushed her into it.,Client,depression,undefined
You don't see that?,Client,depression,undefined
I reject her unequivocally.,Client,depression,undefined
"And the next minute, she's hitting on the nearest guy.",Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, a guy literally on my own doorstep.",Client,depression,undefined
That's not a reaction to me?,Client,depression,undefined
Why would it be?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because she knew Alex would tell me.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, first of all, isn't that a reaction against her boyfriend,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the man she's going to marry?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Why are you the betrayed man, here?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Which would be the worse situation?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
If you realized that you were the center of Laura's life,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"and that she was dating another man to get at you,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
or...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"If... the transference simply faded,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
and she was back to viewing you as a therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"She thought about you during sessions, that's it.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Do you think I'm an egomaniac?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I'm asking which would be the worse situation.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I don't get off on being worshipped by my patients,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't get off on being worshipped by my patients,",Client,neutral,undefined
if that's what you mean. It's not like I'm in some kind of...,Client,neutral,undefined
Some kind of a cult.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If her feelings were to change,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
you wouldn't have a sense of loss?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Pretty clear, how you want me to answer this.",Client,neutral,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Do you not get that I'm concerned about the right and the wrong of this,",Client,anger,undefined
as it affects all my patients?,Client,anger,undefined
"You're very concerned, I can tell that.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But you know,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"sometimes, helping a patient view the world differently",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it's a powerful experience. It's a little addictive.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's a powerful experience because it contributes,Client,neutral,undefined
to somebody's well being.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's not about an inflated sense of...,Client,neutral,undefined
Power. Do you think I'm addicted to power?,Client,neutral,undefined
How...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
How does Laura see you?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What do you mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
"When she looks at you, what does she see?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why?,Client,neutral,undefined
Bear with me.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What does she see?,Client,neutral,undefined
She sees...,Client,depression,undefined
"a man, obviously.",Client,depression,undefined
A lot older than she is.,Client,depression,undefined
An authoritative strong man.,Client,depression,undefined
"She thinks if she could get close to him,",Client,depression,undefined
that she could maybe take on some of his strength.,Client,depression,undefined
"At the same time, she's waiting for him to disappoint her,",Client,depression,undefined
"because, somewhere down the line, inevitably,",Client,depression,undefined
that's her story with men.,Client,depression,undefined
What else?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She thinks I won't be interested in her unless she offers herself sexually.,Client,depression,undefined
She associates concern for her as a woman,Client,depression,undefined
with sex.,Client,depression,undefined
"For her, sex is...",Client,depression,undefined
a currency that she uses to pay for...,Client,depression,undefined
emotional protection from men.,Client,depression,undefined
Don't analyze. Just describe.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Where is this going?,Client,depression,undefined
"No, just stay with it.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"She thinks I'm a coward, which is a bit of a turn off.",Client,depression,undefined
"She believes that I'm totally in love with her, that...",Client,depression,undefined
I think all the rest of my patients are a drag and...,Client,depression,undefined
that I can't wait for her session.,Client,depression,undefined
I assume she...,Client,depression,undefined
I assume she finds me attractive.,Client,depression,undefined
"Otherwise, why would she...",Client,depression,undefined
Isn't this enough?,Client,depression,undefined
"Now,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"you describe her, how you see her.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I would say...,Client,neutral,undefined

"If one had to pick her out of a crowd, I'd say...",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, if you had to pick her out of a crowd.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"God, you're such a stickler.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, She's thirty.",Client,neutral,undefined
She's...,Client,neutral,undefined
beautiful.,Client,neutral,undefined
Great smile...,Client,neutral,undefined
Inquisitive look in her eyes. Really sharp...,Client,neutral,undefined
Very smart...,Client,neutral,undefined
She's got this great laugh that just...,Client,neutral,undefined

"She's childish I'd say. No, not childish,",Client,neutral,undefined
childlike.,Client,neutral,undefined
Vulnerable.,Client,neutral,undefined
It makes you want to...,Client,neutral,undefined
hold her.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's fascinated with sex.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, with the power of sex, as if she were a teenager",Client,neutral,undefined
who's just discovered it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Always, always makes reference to it.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Vivid, sexual experiences that,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I got to say, are very poetic, sometimes.",Client,neutral,undefined
She told me about a summer after her mother died.,Client,depression,undefined
She was 15.,Client,depression,undefined
"And she went to live with this couple in San Diego,",Client,depression,undefined
friends of her father.,Client,depression,undefined
"And she fell in love with this guy, much older than her.",Client,depression,undefined
"It was an escape, I think, from her father who was...",Client,depression,undefined

"depressed and sad,",Client,depression,undefined
after the death of his wife.,Client,depression,undefined
"That can be pretty horrible, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
A child taking care of a parent.,Client,depression,undefined
Like you did after your mother's breakdown.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Nothing worse than a kid...,Client,depression,undefined
playing parents...,Client,depression,undefined

"kind of death, I suppose.",Client,depression,undefined
"For you, it was after your father ran off with his patient.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You keep coming back to that.,Client,depression,undefined
I try to find the roots of your connection to Laura.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's got nothing to do with my father.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Laura's the one re-enacting, not me.",Client,disgust,undefined
Laura's re-enacting this...,Client,disgust,undefined
escape.,Client,disgust,undefined
Because that's what I am to her.,Client,disgust,undefined

I've tried to explain it to her that...,Client,depression,undefined
She's really making me into...,Client,depression,undefined

you said that you felt like you were cutting corners.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You have no patience for your patients that's what you said.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And that, if they knew what you really...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"thought about them, they'd stop coming.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I'm wondering if maybe, that's what you want, for them to stop coming.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why would I want that?,Client,depression,undefined
"Not literally, on an unconscious level.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Unconscious...,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe you want to transfer your patients to me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Where did that come from?,Client,depression,undefined
It's not a real option. It's a wish.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You could dump your patients on me... your problems.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"When I suggested that we find another therapist for Laura,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you immediately assumed that I would treat her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And then, you went down the list. You described each patient.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But isn't that what the sessions are for?,Client,depression,undefined
No. It felt like you were preparing me metaphorically...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"for the day when you hand them over, when you say Here,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
their problems are not my problems.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I have to leave.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, I'm gonna run off to the Caribbean and...",Client,depression,undefined
"I'm gonna be sipping cocktails with Laura, and scuba diving.",Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, what on earth are you on about? I just took on 3 more new patients.",Client,anger,undefined
You said you did that to prove to yourself that everything's OK.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"That couple, you said you don't care if they ever come back.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You don't like the navy pilot.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And sometimes, it seems you're not that upset about Kate.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What?,Client,anger,undefined
Not always.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Sometimes.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe all these things that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
should be bad are really okay.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And then, there's me.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're using me as your accomplice. Not in a practical way.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But emotionally, to help you move on from them.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That way you're free to be with Laura.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know, I don't even want to say to that.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, what... are you doing?",Client,neutral,undefined
Is this what you call help? 'cause that's why I came here.,Client,neutral,undefined
I came here for you to help me. I keep saying this.,Client,anger,undefined
"But through some misguided line of reasoning,",Client,anger,undefined
through some narcissistic...,Client,anger,undefined
"need of yours to save the day, to put yourself at the front and the center,",Client,anger,undefined
we've ended up here.,Client,anger,undefined
In this same place...,Client,anger,undefined
"just to confirm that you, Gina, are right.",Client,anger,undefined
As always.,Client,anger,undefined
"Maybe I misjudged you, I don't know.",Client,depression,undefined
I thought you were better than this.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, I've got to say you really sometimes are so infuriating.",Client,depression,undefined
The way you keep coming back to your pet theories. My father...,Client,depression,undefined
Kate...,Client,depression,undefined
I guess I'd better go.,Client,depression,undefined
"Have a good week, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You too.,Client,depression,undefined
Sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said that it. That it happened in the kitchen?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, it started in the kitchen.",Client,neutral,undefined
Are you listening to me?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, yes, I am.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I said I wanted to do it right there on the counter.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So when he picked me up, I thought, okay, but",Client,neutral,undefined
"no, he took me into the bedroom and he.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Put me down ever so gently like I was,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know, a porcelain vase or something.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Everything was very cautious, hesitant.",Client,neutral,undefined
Like he didn't know what to do.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe he didn't know what to do with someone who wasn't his wife.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, he kept telling me he hasn't done it with anyone but his wife",Client,neutral,undefined
"for 10 years, and hardly then.",Client,neutral,undefined
"It was very sweet, actually.",Client,joy,undefined
He imitated me.,Client,joy,undefined
He did everything I did.,Client,joy,undefined
"I took off his shirt, he took off my shirt.",Client,joy,undefined
"I told him he has a fantastic body, because",Client,joy,undefined
"he does, and he goes, so do you.",Client,joy,undefined
"At one point, he strokes my hair and he asks me what kind of shampoo I use.",Client,joy,undefined
Can you believe this?,Client,joy,undefined
"We're lying there, face to face, petting each other like high school kids.",Client,joy,undefined
"Anyway, I get sick of it, so I say to myself,",Client,joy,undefined
maybe he's waiting for a signal.,Client,joy,undefined
"You know, maybe he wants me to lead.",Client,joy,undefined
"Maybe if I start doing something, you know, things will",Client,joy,undefined
finally get moving. So,Client,joy,undefined
I went down on him.,Client,neutral,undefined
Everything was so proper.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I didn't want proper. I just wanted him to fuck,",Client,neutral,undefined
without all the bullshit about my shampoo,Client,neutral,undefined
and my beautiful breasts and my excellent taste in curtains.,Client,neutral,undefined
So did that move things along?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What? The blowjob?,Client,neutral,undefined
emhua...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Of course.,Client,joy,undefined
But you know what?,Client,joy,undefined
He doesn't like sex.,Client,joy,undefined
You know what I mean? He doesn't really like it.,Client,joy,undefined
"It's like he's carrying out an assignment, a mission, like a pilot.",Client,joy,undefined
"What do you mean, like a pilot?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You know those air force guys that mark tally points on the wings,Client,joy,undefined
of their fighter jet to keep track of how many planes they've shot down?,Client,joy,undefined
"It was like that, like he was keeping score.",Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, he didn't even touch me while he was going at it.",Client,joy,undefined
"He was just, you know,",Client,neutral,undefined
leaning on his elbows as if he didn't want any connection between us...,Client,neutral,undefined
Except where necessary.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I kept,Client,neutral,undefined
trying to bring my face closer to his to kiss,Client,neutral,undefined
him and he just...,Client,neutral,undefined
Kept pulling his face away...,Client,neutral,undefined
As if he couldn't stand me.,Client,neutral,undefined
And that was it. It was very fast.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Two minutes, more or less, and then he came.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And then he went straight the bathroom and I just laid there in shock. I mean,",Client,neutral,undefined
"he didn't even ask me how it was, if I was okay or not. Nothing.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, I made myself come.",Client,neutral,undefined
While he was in the bathroom?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, when he got back.",Client,neutral,undefined
I had to.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, I hate to be left high and dry.",Client,joy,undefined
"He was just lying conducting dialogue,",Client,neutral,undefined
"the ceiling or maybe with his wife,",Client,neutral,undefined
"or maybe with you,",Client,neutral,undefined
and he looked so fucking sexy. So I.,Client,neutral,undefined
I climbed on top of his leg.,Client,neutral,undefined
I thought he'd get the hint and he'd start something.,Client,neutral,undefined
But nothing.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I just kept going...,Client,joy,undefined
Riding his thigh.,Client,joy,undefined
It felt good.,Client,joy,undefined
And then I was overwhelmed with this sadness for him.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He broke my heart, this guy.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He's fragile, really. That's what he is.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't think he could tell what I was thinking.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was completely in my own head, and I was thinking to myself, shit,",Client,joy,undefined
this is gonna be the saddest orgasm of my life.,Client,joy,undefined
"Here I am riding this hot, sad guy's thigh.",Client,joy,undefined
"I was expecting something pitiful and measly, right?",Client,joy,undefined
But no.,Client,joy,undefined
"A volcano is a cliche, but that's what it was.",Client,joy,undefined
It was like 10 orgasms exploding at once.,Client,joy,undefined
It's hard to describe.,Client,joy,undefined
But I screamed--,Client,joy,undefined
"I did, I screamed and I think I scared him.",Client,joy,undefined
You would have been really proud of me.,Client,joy,undefined
Why would I have been proud?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, as my therapist.",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, that I finally...",Client,neutral,undefined
Connected with myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
Doesn't happen very often.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
That was a bit revealing.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you must be used to it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, hearing confessions like that, it probably doesn't impress you anymore.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Actually, it makes a very big impression.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Really? What sort of impression?,Client,neutral,undefined
Well...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You can look at it in all kinds of ways, but one",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
thing seems perfectly plain to me: you slept with my patient.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Excuse me?,Client,anger,undefined
He isn't your only patient. He doesn't belong to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"He's a great guy, okay?",Client,anger,undefined
"A little fucked up, a little insecure in bed, maybe, but he's got potential.",Client,anger,undefined
I think I'm gonna have a terrific affair with him.,Client,anger,undefined
"Nevertheless, it's no coincidence that you went to bed with him",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and I don't think it's any coincidence that you began,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
your affair with him shortly after we talked about your quitting therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you saying that I did this to get back at you?,Client,neutral,undefined
Remember the guy you told me about.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"The guy that you met at the bar, that you went to the restroom with?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said that you felt you were with me.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"It's not the same thing, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
Are you sure it isn't?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"It was during that session, Laura,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you decided to tell me that you were in love with me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And that's how you chose to tell me how you felt about me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
By having sex with another man.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Paul, if there's one thing that I put right out there,",Client,anger,undefined
"without hinting or manipulation, is that I've wanted you.",Client,anger,undefined
So I don't need to fuck another man just to get my message across.,Client,anger,undefined
What made you so...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Sad about Alex?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
His loneliness. He's a sad guy.,Client,depression,undefined
Did you feel sad?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I felt horny.",Client,neutral,undefined
So sadness for him but no sadness for yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What are you trying to get at here?,Client,disgust,undefined
Maybe you did feel sadness...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because you were with a man you didn't really want to be with.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Are you saying that when I was fucking Alex, I was actually fucking you?",Client,disgust,undefined
Were you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Don't flatter yourself.,Client,disgust,undefined
"It's not really a compliment, Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I think it seems more like, look what you missed out on, Paul. You",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"coward, you idiot.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm tired.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm really so tired.,Client,depression,undefined
"So,",Client,depression,undefined
after,Client,depression,undefined
"Alex left, I",Client,depression,undefined
couldn't fall asleep.,Client,depression,undefined
I suddenly had this incredible craving for cheesecake.,Client,joy,undefined
Cheesecake.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You know those amazingly fluffy cheesecakes with that amazing smell?,Client,joy,undefined
"Well, my mother used to bake those.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Every friday afternoon,",Client,neutral,undefined
"after I finished playing with my friends, I used to come home and",Client,neutral,undefined
that smell.,Client,neutral,undefined
It was intoxicating.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It was like a trail of scent paving my way home,",Client,joy,undefined
like a cartoon character.,Client,joy,undefined
Then my mother got sick.,Client,depression,undefined
The cancer was only stage one at that point,Client,depression,undefined
when they found it.,Client,depression,undefined
"But when she started chemo, she stopped baking.",Client,depression,undefined
"You know, she was tired. She,",Client,depression,undefined
she had no energy.,Client,depression,undefined
And that was the first sign. The first sign,Client,depression,undefined
that something really big was about to happen.,Client,depression,undefined
"And when she was really sick, I used to find myself",Client,depression,undefined
"roaming the halls of the apartment building,",Client,depression,undefined
"climbing up and down the stairs, searching for that smell of cheesecake.",Client,depression,undefined
"Shit, how corny is that?",Client,depression,undefined
And once I rember a woman coming out of her apartment,Client,sadness,undefined
"and she, thank you.",Client,sadness,undefined
And she saw me standing out there. She didn't know who I was.,Client,sadness,undefined
She must have been new to the building.,Client,sadness,undefined
"And she was yelling at me,",Client,sadness,undefined
"Go away, go on, go home.",Client,sadness,undefined
"What are you doing, standing out here, just...",Client,sadness,undefined
Why do you think you had that...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
particular memory the other night?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,sadness,undefined
I searched...,Client,sadness,undefined
through my whole apartment looking for a recipe but...,Client,sadness,undefined
Not that that would have done any good. My fridge is completely empty.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I thought about going out to get a piece,",Client,sadness,undefined
"but it was 3:00 a.m., so I just gave up and went to sleep.",Client,sadness,undefined
"Only then the phone rang and it was Alex, he called to...",Client,disgust,undefined
"thank me, tell me that he had an amazing time with me",Client,disgust,undefined
and that he wants to see me again.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Go figure, huh?",Client,disgust,undefined
He's supposed to pick me up from here pretty soon.,Client,disgust,undefined
From here?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, that's what he said.",Client,depression,undefined
Aren't you afraid that Andrew will find out about this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Or, maybe you want to get caught.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Andrew and I split up.,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
For good.,Client,depression,undefined
And it is for good. He's a nice guy.,Client,depression,undefined
He'll make a nice husband for someone who deserves him.,Client,depression,undefined
But obviously not for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I nearly fuck guys in bathroom stalls,",Client,disgust,undefined
as you very kindly reminded me.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I just couldn't stand up there in front of everyone, promise to...",Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, I just shouldn't ever make promises.",Client,disgust,undefined
I promise not to make any more promises.,Client,disgust,undefined
How's that?,Client,disgust,undefined
"So I told him that... I'm sorry, but I can't marry you.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I am incapable of being the woman you want, the kind of woman you deserve.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I put it all on me. Well, 'cause it is all me.",Client,disgust,undefined
"And he looked at me and he said: Thank you, Laura.",Client,disgust,undefined
Thank you.,Client,disgust,undefined
God exists. It's a fact.,Client,disgust,undefined
"He's made me realize who and what you are,",Client,disgust,undefined
"and He's saved me from a long, endless death with you.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Flattering, no?",Client,disgust,undefined
He must be devastated.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe he feels...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't care how he feels.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't care how he feels.,Client,anger,undefined
You don't care...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Not now, I don't feel like talking about Andrew's side of the story.",Client,anger,undefined
Why does that make you so upset?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I'm the one in therapy here.,Client,anger,undefined
Andrew has his own therapist. She'll take care of him.,Client,anger,undefined
"Don't worry about him, worry about me.",Client,anger,undefined
I am taking care of you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're kicking me out of therapy.,Client,anger,undefined
I am not kicking you out of therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I brought it up as an option.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Don't sugarcoat it.,Client,anger,undefined
You even tried to blame it on me.,Client,anger,undefined
You made up the most ridiculous case as to why I was late.,Client,anger,undefined
"It was nasty, a bullshit excuse.",Client,anger,undefined
"Instead of leveling with me and saying: Listen,",Client,anger,undefined
"I've feelings for you too, it's hard for me to deal with.",Client,anger,undefined
"Instead of figuring it out so we could continue therapy, so we could...",Client,anger,undefined
"We could be together, Is that's your mean?",Therapist,disgust,Restatement
"We've been together for a year, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
A year.,Client,anger,undefined
There is more intimacy between us than most couples in the world.,Client,anger,undefined
Isn't that right?,Client,anger,undefined
"I don't deny that there's a certain intimacy, that can...",Therapist,disgust,Self-disclosure
A certain intimacy... Intimacy-like...,Client,anger,undefined
Cut the crap.,Client,anger,undefined
Is there intimacy here or not?,Client,anger,undefined
"Yes, There is.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And now you're willing to throw that all away.,Client,depression,undefined
And why? Because you're scared?,Client,depression,undefined
"I know that as a therapist,",Client,disgust,undefined
you tell yourself it's part of therapy to find out,Client,disgust,undefined
why I'm in love with you and how that's linked to my past and all that.,Client,disgust,undefined
But isn't that always the way it works?,Client,anger,undefined
Doesn't our past always determine who we fall in love with?,Client,anger,undefined
"What if you can trace it back to the withholding mother,",Client,anger,undefined
"the narcissistic father, the parent who's missing in action.",Client,anger,undefined
Does that make our love any less real?,Client,anger,undefined
"But sometimes circumstances are, let's say,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
less than ideal.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I know that.,Client,anger,undefined
I know you can delude yourself into think...,Client,anger,undefined
Only I am not deluded.,Client,anger,undefined
"Not about you, not about how I feel about you, why I feel it.",Client,anger,undefined
"There's always got to be an explanation, but that I feel it is irrefutable.",Client,anger,undefined
I don't know how to convince you anymore.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, you think that I've imagined this fairy tale, this...",Client,anger,undefined
happily-ever-after. That I've idealized you.,Client,anger,undefined
You think this is a case of a miserable patient sitting in front of her...,Client,anger,undefined
her therapist imaging that you're my superman...,Client,anger,undefined
"Perfect, savior,",Client,anger,undefined
mentor. I don't see you that way at all.,Client,anger,undefined
How do you really see me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I see you the way you are...,Client,neutral,undefined
Your imperfections.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You're not at ease with your body, with your profession,",Client,neutral,undefined
with who you've become.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know much about your life, but I...",Client,neutral,undefined
I imagine you're not happy at home.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Something in you is restless, damaged.",Client,neutral,undefined
"There's a yearning there, and I know it when I see it.",Client,neutral,undefined
And I want you just the way you are...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Damaged and restless, yearning...",Client,neutral,undefined
Warts and all.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you can fix me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"God, you can be such a fucking prick when you wannabe.",Client,disgust,undefined
So that I can fix you then?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You know, next month I'll be 30.",Client,depression,undefined
And I've been thinking to myself...,Client,depression,undefined
I've hated myself for 30 years.,Client,depression,undefined
It's enough. I don't want to anymore.,Client,depression,undefined
Why do you hate yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You're surprised?,Client,neutral,undefined
I've never heard you say it before.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I guess you save the best for last.,Client,joy,undefined
That's the best?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That you hate yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. You're surprised?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's something people realize after an hour.,Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't know it after an hour. Neither after a year.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's not easy for me to hear you say that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Maybe you should try and find out why it's so hard for you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe you should see someone.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've been thinking about that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I think the reason it's hard for me to hear it is because,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I know that you have so many reasons to...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"to love yourself,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
so many things to be...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"To be really proud of, yet you choose to ignore them.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Haven't you ever hated yourself?,Client,neutral,undefined
Haven't you ever hated yourself?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I guess I did...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
: Once.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I was a kid. You know?,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
My mother...,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
she was in pretty bad shape and...,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
"I took care of her, but...",Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
I couldn't...,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
I couldn't save her...,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
"From herself, you know?",Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
I guess I hated myself for that.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
Was she sick?,Client,neutral,undefined
She was in a difficult emotional state.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
I thought that I could pull her out of it.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
"I used to cook her all these, you know, elaborate meals.",Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
But she wouldn't eat them. Couldn't understand why.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
"Like every kid, I thought it was my fault.",Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
It was something that I wasn't doing.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
Maybe I could do something else.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
But you know that's not true.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I know that now, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Have you forgiven yourself?,Client,neutral,undefined
I think so.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Took a long time.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
How does that feel?,Client,neutral,undefined
I mean really. I'm curious.,Client,joy,undefined
It feels like a relief,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"to tell you the truth,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
to know that that burden is gone...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
The burden of blame.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And to know deep down that...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
it never belonged there in the first place.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Maybe that's why you became a psychologist...,Client,joy,undefined
To help others with their burdens.,Client,joy,undefined
Maybe.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So you're a product of your past too.,Client,joy,undefined
Will that be cash or check?,Client,joy,undefined
Can I owe you that?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Sure.,Client,joy,undefined
"Anyway, I know where you live.",Client,joy,undefined
"Yes, you do.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Do you feel better now?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What do you mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
"After paying me, do you feel better?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What are you trying to say?,Client,neutral,undefined
I guess that I'm...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm surprised by how much effort you put into,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
showing your contempt for this process and for me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Relax, okay?",Client,neutral,undefined
It's just the way my mother raised me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know what it's like with you people.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't like charity, so I like to pay for what I get.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I'm glad you're getting something here, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Listen, let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?",Client,neutral,undefined
You want me to admit that this therapy is worthwhile?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, I'll admit it:",Client,neutral,undefined
this therapy is changing my life.,Client,neutral,undefined
Happy? Can we drop it now?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Like today, how many patients already?",Client,neutral,undefined
Why are you asking me this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Cause I wanna know what kind of money you make.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Let's say you have 8 patients a day, times 5 days a week,",Client,neutral,undefined
$150 a pop.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's pretty good living there, doc.",Client,neutral,undefined
$24 grand a month.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Do you wanna buy me out, alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, $24,000 a month and I'm all yours.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
And you'll be my only patient.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"It must be hard for you to be in this position,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to be perceived as weak.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you have this need to regain your strength.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You bring me a check from laura.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You've asked me about my patients and my income.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you've done everything you can to put me in my little place.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did I offend you?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I'm kind of used to it.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"But then all our sessions start out like that, don't they, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Maybe I was expecting something a little different today,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"maybe because you were early,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or because...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you've been asking around about me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Do you want me to tell you why I was early,",Client,depression,undefined
or do you wanna just go on and on with your theories?,Client,depression,undefined
I'd love to hear.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I went to the base today.,Client,depression,undefined
I thought I'd pop over before my session here and say hello to my boys.,Client,depression,undefined
"When I got to the gate, I realized I forgot my id.",Client,depression,undefined
Now usually that's not a big deal.,Client,depression,undefined
But there's a new grunt at the gate...,Client,depression,undefined
Some real...,Client,depression,undefined
okie from Muskogee.,Client,depression,undefined
"I told him, look, call the base commander",Client,depression,undefined
and tell him that lieutenant Prince is here.,Client,depression,undefined
"So he goes in the booth, calls, comes back a minute later,",Client,depression,undefined
and he says I'm not on the approved list.,Client,depression,undefined
"Now of course this is a real sensitive issue these days, as you can imagine.",Client,depression,undefined
"Still I said, To hell with the list. This is what you do: you call Dana",Client,depression,undefined
"the secretary, tell her to talk to the commander,",Client,depression,undefined
and you tell him that lieutenant Alex Prince Jr.,Client,depression,undefined
is waiting at the gate.,Client,depression,undefined
"So he goes in, he calls, he comes back, and he says...",Client,depression,undefined
"He says, I'm sorry, but the commander is in a meeting.",Client,depression,undefined
Now maybe he was in a meeting and he couldn't be disturbed.,Client,depression,undefined
Or maybe they were stuffing their faces with doughnuts.,Client,depression,undefined
Or maybe he just didn't give a fuck. I don't know.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I told that guard, I said, Look, you tell Dana",Client,anger,undefined
"if she took the commander's cock out of her fucking mouth once in a while,",Client,anger,undefined
then maybe she could hear better.,Client,anger,undefined
"Man, I was this close to knocking that motherfucker out.",Client,anger,undefined
"Anyway, I didn't get in so I left.",Client,disgust,undefined
And that is why I got here early.,Client,disgust,undefined
Not...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Not an easy experience.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, it's bullshit.",Client,disgust,undefined
Now I gotta come and deal with this? I got you coming at me like this?,Client,disgust,undefined
That was the tip of the iceberg. My shitty week started on saturday.,Client,depression,undefined
Why? What happened on saturday?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Okay, we're gonna pretend here. All right.",Client,disgust,undefined
We can pretend.,Client,disgust,undefined
You know what happened.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do I?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I wish you would've warned me about Laura last week.,Client,depression,undefined
I wish you would've warned me about Laura last week.,Client,depression,undefined
It would have saved us both a lot of heartache.,Client,depression,undefined
"I slept with her, okay?",Client,depression,undefined
With Laura.,Client,depression,undefined
That's what happened on saturday.,Client,depression,undefined
But I'm sure you got a full play-by-play from her already.,Client,depression,undefined
Did she or did she not talk to you about it?,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm not at liberty to discuss my patients or their sessions.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Now what is that?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Code language for she did discuss it, but you won't tell me?",Client,disgust,undefined
"Alex, No.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
It was pretty weird.,Client,depression,undefined
She called to ask me if I wanted to come over for dinner.,Client,depression,undefined
"No problem, right?",Client,depression,undefined
"So when I got to her place,",Client,depression,undefined
I looked at her.,Client,depression,undefined
I looked at how she was dressed. I looked at the table.,Client,depression,undefined
I looked at the wine. And...,Client,depression,undefined
I realized that dinner was obviously just a code name for sex.,Client,depression,undefined
This whole thing was like a ritual.,Client,depression,undefined
A ritual?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, and all the rules.",Client,depression,undefined
"First, of course, there's the meal. She doesn't look like a cook, right?",Client,depression,undefined
But she made a big effort.,Client,depression,undefined
"For starters, she prepared her own sushi...",Client,depression,undefined
California rolls.,Client,depression,undefined
They weren't that great actually.,Client,depression,undefined
It didn't taste good?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was just for show. Don't you get it?,Client,depression,undefined
"That's the problem nowadays, everything's for show.",Client,disgust,undefined
"If you wanna make sushi, take a fucking course.",Client,disgust,undefined
Go to a real japanese grocery.,Client,disgust,undefined
Don't make it with uncle Ben's rice and imitation crabmeat.,Client,disgust,undefined
Come on.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Did you say anything to her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Of course not, no.",Client,depression,undefined
The dinner was just a lead up to us getting in bed.,Client,depression,undefined
I told you that.,Client,depression,undefined
It didn't really matter.,Client,depression,undefined
So did you want to sleep with her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, but...",Client,depression,undefined
it has nothing to do with wanting anything.,Client,depression,undefined
"It was all premeditated. It was like a mating ritual,",Client,depression,undefined
"like the masai tribe in Tanzania, but for yuppies.",Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, so we got up from the table, we went to her bedroom and had sex.",Client,depression,undefined
And that's what happened on saturday.,Client,depression,undefined
It's interesting that you tell me so much about this,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"ritual of you going to bed together, but...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
nothing about what happened between you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I'm sure that you've had lousy sushi before, but...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't think you've been with another woman for a long time.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Isn't that correct?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
But you know what happened.,Client,depression,undefined
So why do you have to hear it from me?,Client,depression,undefined
But you know what happened.,Client,depression,undefined
So why do you have to hear it from me?,Client,depression,undefined
It's interesting that you tell me so much about this,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"ritual of you going to bed together, but...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
nothing about what happened between you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I'm sure that you've had lousy sushi before, but...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't think you've been with another woman for a long time.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Isn't that correct?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
But you know what happened.,Client,depression,undefined
So why do you have to hear it from me?,Client,depression,undefined
You're very preoccupied with who knows what and who said what.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"What's important is how you felt about it,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
how the experience was for you.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The sex?,Client,depression,undefined
The sex is all that anyone wants to talk about.,Client,depression,undefined
But is it really as important as you people make it out to be?,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, you tell me.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I know that's what it says in all your textbooks. I know that.,Client,depression,undefined
"But I ask myself, Is it really the key to everything?",Client,depression,undefined
Or is it just the simplest answer?,Client,depression,undefined
"but you're the one who started the story by saying that the sex was the issue,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that all the rest was just... foreplay.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Okay, I'll tell you what happened.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Otherwise you won't feel like you're doing your job, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"But before I start,",Client,neutral,undefined
there's something I've gotta know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you ever jerk off to anything a patient told you?,Client,joy,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Come on.,Client,joy,undefined
"Come on, you must hear some crazy stories from women...",Client,joy,undefined
"Explicit shit, fantasies.",Client,joy,undefined
Did you ever jerk off afterwards?,Client,joy,undefined
Are you concerned that I'll masturbate to something that you tell me?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Me? No.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm talking about you've got women they sit here on your couch.,Client,neutral,undefined
They tell you all about fucking.,Client,neutral,undefined
It must get to you sometimes. I know it would get to me.,Client,joy,undefined
Do you masturbate?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"There you go again, you're answering a question with a question.",Client,neutral,undefined
"All right, i'll answer with an answer.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm a human being. I masturbate sometimes.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"My fantasies are about many many things,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
all sorts of women. Is that what you wanted to hear?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That in that regard i'm not that substantially different from you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's the first time you've ever answered one of my questions.,Client,neutral,undefined
"In any case, you won't masturbate to me and Laura's story.",Client,depression,undefined
I guarantee you that.,Client,depression,undefined
You may think of it the next time you're having sex with your wife,Client,depression,undefined
and you're trying not to come.,Client,depression,undefined
It must have been a very...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"complex experience for you,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
being with...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Being with another woman after all this time.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Complex, right.",Client,joy,undefined
I gave a shitty performance.,Client,joy,undefined
"I made every possible mistake. I was a mess,",Client,joy,undefined
to tell you the truth.,Client,joy,undefined
"During dinner, before we had sex,",Client,depression,undefined
I started thinking about my first date with my wife Michaela,Client,depression,undefined
about 15 years ago.,Client,depression,undefined
Jesus.,Client,depression,undefined
"We had gone out to this bar together, at the time she was the liberal type.",Client,depression,undefined
She'd talk openly about everything...,Client,depression,undefined
"Foreplay, favorite positions, cuddling afterwards...",Client,depression,undefined
cosmo type bullshit.,Client,depression,undefined
"And among other things, she told me that researchers found that wine",Client,depression,undefined
arouses women sexually and represses men's sexual desires.,Client,depression,undefined
Have you ever heard that?,Client,depression,undefined
emhua...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I don't know what made me do it, but at one point",Client,neutral,undefined
"during my conversation with laura,",Client,neutral,undefined
we hit one of those deadly silences.,Client,neutral,undefined
I suddenly told her that,Client,depression,undefined
"alcohol sexually represses men,",Client,depression,undefined
"while women, it...",Client,depression,undefined
"And she... of course, she didn't respond.",Client,depression,undefined
"She just gave me one of those looks saying, Why are you telling me this?",Client,depression,undefined
Why did you tell her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe it was a way to...,Client,neutral,undefined
"move the conversation in a sexual direction, make things go forward.",Client,neutral,undefined
A kind of signal that she had been cleared to attack.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that what you wanted? For her to... attack?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you think that she understood the signal?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is there another way of getting it?,Client,neutral,undefined
It might have sounded like,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
an apology in advance that you didn't have any...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
real sexual...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
desire for her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't think so. She wasn't even too fazed by it.,Client,depression,undefined
"She just changed the subject right away,",Client,disgust,undefined
"like I had said something nasty,",Client,disgust,undefined
something inappropriate at the table with all that sushi.,Client,disgust,undefined
And that's what pissed me off.,Client,disgust,undefined
Like all her faggy doctor friends,Client,disgust,undefined
she hangs out with always say exactly the right thing.,Client,disgust,undefined
"So listen, the first chance I got, I looked her right in the eye and I said",Client,depression,undefined
"Baby, I have to go to the bathroom.",Client,depression,undefined
I'm a bit nervous. It's my first time,Client,depression,undefined
since I left my wife.,Client,depression,undefined
"This time she could barely squeeze out a smile,",Client,depression,undefined
"even a phony one. And from then on, every few minutes, i'd mention my wife",Client,depression,undefined
and the separation... Even in bed.,Client,depression,undefined
I did it every chance I got just to see her squirm.,Client,disgust,undefined
I think I got her completely out of the mood.,Client,disgust,undefined
She was totally turned off.,Client,disgust,undefined
We had sex.,Client,disgust,undefined
It was more like two animals mating.,Client,disgust,undefined
I wasn't that hard and I came pretty fast.,Client,disgust,undefined
Even on the way to the shower I threw in another,Client,disgust,undefined
"I'm sorry, it was my first time in so many years, just for dessert.",Client,disgust,undefined
I don't know why I kept saying it.,Client,depression,undefined
Were you thinking about your wife?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,depression,undefined
Or feeling guilty maybe?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, why would i?",Client,depression,undefined
"Well, because any of those reactions would have been natural, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
We haven't talked about your...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Your separation, how you feel about it.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"No, that's not what this is about.",Client,neutral,undefined
The separation was the right thing to do.,Client,neutral,undefined
I haven't even looked back on that. Don't you get off topic.,Client,neutral,undefined
What is the topic?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Do our stories match, me and laura's? That's what I want to know.",Client,depression,undefined
"Look, on the one hand, you describe this feeling of...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"helplessness, weakness,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
as if you were dragged into sex against your will.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You feel that you didn't perform too well,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so you felt...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Somewhat humiliated.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Then to gain back,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"some strength and control,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you make these references to your wife...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in order to belittle Laura.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Belittle her?,Client,depression,undefined
You really make some pretty far-out connections.,Client,depression,undefined
She belittled me. Her whole attitude is...,Client,disgust,undefined
It's patronizing.,Client,disgust,undefined
You're sure?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You're the one who suddenly felt weak, so you attacked.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You wanted to regain control.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It reminds me of the beginning of our session when you came in here.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You were vulnerable from what happened at the base.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You give me the envelope from Laura,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"and then you throw your money on the table,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"as if you wanted to humiliate me, to make me feel small.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
How's your machine?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's good. Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Are the clients happy?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm gonna make me some coffee, by the way, if you want some.",Client,neutral,undefined
If you've decided to stop being a tea man.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Alex, can we get back to this, please?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
We're onto something here and I don't want to lose track.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Just give me a second here, okay?",Client,neutral,undefined
I realize we're onto something. I just need a break.,Client,anger,undefined
Respect that.,Client,anger,undefined
I want you to tell me something...,Client,depression,undefined
Honestly.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you really think you can help me?,Client,depression,undefined
If we sit here and we talk about fucking a few times...,Client,depression,undefined
You'll be able to solve all my problems?,Client,depression,undefined
I don't have the answer to that question.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, I knew you'd say that.",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, that's what kills me about you people.",Client,depression,undefined
Cause any other professional...,Client,depression,undefined
"I go to a doctor, he takes a look and he says, This is what you got.",Client,depression,undefined
This is how long you have to live.,Client,depression,undefined
"If I went to a mechanic, he'd say,",Client,depression,undefined
"$2,000, it'll be good as new.",Client,depression,undefined
"But you people, you don't guarantee shit.",Client,disgust,undefined
Can I tell you a story?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What kind of story?,Client,depression,undefined
It's a jewish parable that a friend of mine told me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"These two friends are condemned to death, but the king...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He liked them and he didn't want to kill them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So instead, he tied...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"a thin rope across this abyss,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and he told them both to walk over the rope.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Whoever made it to the other side would be allowed to live.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So the first one walked over the rope,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and he makes it safely to the other side.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And after he made it, his friend yells out to him,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How did you do it?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And the other guy answered,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I have no idea.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
All I know is that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
whenever my weight pulled me to one side...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I leaned to the other.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It ain't exactly <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.,Client,neutral,undefined
True.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So what does it mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
That you have to maintain balance in your life?,Client,neutral,undefined
I think what it means is,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"that there are no simple ways of jumping over an abyss,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
or ways that work for everyone.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I think what you're looking for, alex,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"is a million-dollar magic trick, and I don't have that.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I truly believe there is no simple way to jump across an abyss.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Instead, we have to work in",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
small internal steps.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"The question is whether you want us,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"you and i, to engage in that process.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Eyes on your instruments.,Client,depression,undefined
What do you mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's one of the basic principles in aviation.,Client,depression,undefined
You ever heard of vertigo?,Client,depression,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
When you go into vertigo your directional perception changes.,Client,depression,undefined
You're spatially disoriented.,Client,depression,undefined
You'd be flying at mach 2 nose down and think you're taking off.,Client,depression,undefined
So that's the first thing they teach you at pilot school.,Client,depression,undefined
"You go into vertigo, you look only at your aircraft's instruments.",Client,depression,undefined
Ignore your feelings completely.,Client,depression,undefined
Rely on your instruments. That's what the air controller tells you,Client,depression,undefined
"if he thinks you're freaking out, and that's what you're telling me now.",Client,depression,undefined
Eyes on your instruments.,Client,depression,undefined
So you want me to...,Client,depression,undefined
put myself into your hands. You wanna navigate me.,Client,depression,undefined
Rely on you.,Client,depression,undefined
"And on one hand, you're right. That's why I came in the first place.",Client,depression,undefined
But keeping my eyes on the instruments is what got me here.,Client,depression,undefined
What do you mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"'Cause I kept my eyes on the instrument, I dropped that bomb",Client,depression,undefined
so accurately into that window.,Client,depression,undefined
I relied only on my commanders.,Client,depression,undefined
And I killed innocent people.,Client,depression,undefined
And now I'm supposed to rely on you.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Alex, I don't want you to rely on me.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I want you to rely on yourself, on your own feelings.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
The most I can ever be to you is...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
an air traffic controller who tells you to try to ignore,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
the expectations of everybody else.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
It's the expectations that give you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That give you vertigo.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"What's the first step,",Client,neutral,undefined
on the way to my new life?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, what...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
What would you like to do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think I'll go fuck her again.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I'll fuck her,",Client,neutral,undefined
well and proper this time. I'll fuck her slow and good.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'll take my time up into that...,Client,joy,undefined
"sweet, hot little pussy.",Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, what's the big deal?",Client,neutral,undefined
She thinks she's the belle of the ball. Fuck that.,Client,disgust,undefined
"She must be pretty miserable if she's coming to see you, right?",Client,disgust,undefined
"Don't assume that everybody who comes to see me is miserable, alex.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Look, doc, when I came to pick her up from here yesterday",Client,neutral,undefined
she was like a complete psychopath.,Client,neutral,undefined
"One minute she's hugging me, completely over the top",Client,neutral,undefined
like we're in some kind of movie.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The next minute, I close the car door, and she's like, Take me home.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I'm too tired to do anything today. I mean, what the fuck?",Client,disgust,undefined
She turned as cold as ice.,Client,disgust,undefined
She was two totally different people.,Client,disgust,undefined
Go figure what goes through her head.,Client,disgust,undefined
Listen to what you're saying.,Therapist,neutral,Others
You're belittling her again.,Therapist,neutral,Others
"Hey, you don't think she belittles me?",Client,anger,undefined
You don't think I know she's completely and totally hung up on someone else?,Client,anger,undefined
Check this out.,Client,anger,undefined
"Saturday, after we had sex, she straddles my leg.",Client,anger,undefined
She starts rubbing up against me,Client,anger,undefined
as if i'm not even there.,Client,anger,undefined
It so obvious she's fantasizing about somebody else.,Client,anger,undefined
And then she starts crying.,Client,disgust,undefined
Tears and everything.,Client,disgust,undefined
"She's just crying, and I ask her, Laura, what's up?",Client,disgust,undefined
Everything okay?,Client,disgust,undefined
She doesn't even look at me.,Client,disgust,undefined
"She doesn't even answer me,",Client,disgust,undefined
like I'm just her dildo. So...,Client,disgust,undefined
"Don't tell me I belittle her, okay?",Client,anger,undefined
I know this is going to sound crazy after everything I just said...,Client,neutral,undefined
"But do you think we have a chance together, me and laura?",Client,joy,undefined
If we really work at it?,Client,joy,undefined
"I don't know, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I couldn't even...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't know that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think it could happen.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, like you said, doc, it's a long series of...",Client,neutral,undefined
"small steps, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
Yes it is.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Well, our time is up for today.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Already?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why don't we continue next week,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"where we left off today, okay?",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Thanks.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're welcome.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Hello.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Charmed, I'm sure.",Client,joy,undefined
It's the middle of the night for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm utterly exhausted.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was at this amazing party last night.,Client,joy,undefined
It went on and on.,Client,neutral,undefined
I stayed awake all night and then I walked here.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No food, no sleep,",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm running on empty.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've never had so much to drink in my whole life.,Client,neutral,undefined
"There was this guy, this new guy--",Client,neutral,undefined
Total eye candy.,Client,neutral,undefined
He kept walking around with tequila shots.,Client,neutral,undefined
He kept making me drink them.,Client,joy,undefined
I must've had...,Client,joy,undefined
I don't know.,Client,joy,undefined
I've never been so wrecked in my whole life.,Client,joy,undefined
I have to take them off. Do you mind?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You've grown hands.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's crazy how quickly a person gets used to things.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When I had the casts, it was like",Client,neutral,undefined
"they'd always been a part of me, you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
Like I'd been born a monster.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Now, two days after they're gone,",Client,neutral,undefined
"it's like, casts? What casts?",Client,neutral,undefined
Can't believe I bought them.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I buy shoes basically never, and when I do...",Client,neutral,undefined
"They make you want to vomit, don't they?",Client,neutral,undefined
It's your fault I bought them.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
My mom took me shopping last week.,Client,neutral,undefined
I thought she was trying to be maternal or something.,Client,neutral,undefined
Turns out we were only there because you called her and told her,Client,neutral,undefined
I was gonna off myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
"That's not what I said, Sophie.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, whatever.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, honestly, I never said that.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I said whatever.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Anyway, I picked out this jacket,",Client,depression,undefined
"this army thing that she, of course, hated.",Client,depression,undefined
Then as punishment she said that I had to buy something feminine.,Client,depression,undefined
She picked out those barbie shoes,Client,depression,undefined
while I pretended to retch on the makeup counter.,Client,depression,undefined
"If I had known you'd called her, I never would've gone shopping.",Client,depression,undefined
And then she wonders why I run off to the gym to be with her.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, to be without her.",Client,depression,undefined
To get the hell away from her.,Client,depression,undefined
For my last birthday she gave me a bra.,Client,disgust,undefined
A bra for my birthday?,Client,disgust,undefined
It's like getting coal.,Client,disgust,undefined
It's worse than getting coal. At least you can burn coal.,Client,disgust,undefined
It was one of those pushy-uppy wonder things with the clicky wheel.,Client,joy,undefined
You know?,Client,joy,undefined
"Half-bra, half-machine.",Client,neutral,undefined
She wants me to be some sort of a fucking cheerleader.,Client,neutral,undefined
You want to know why she really hates that I'm a gymnast?,Client,depression,undefined
Because of my boobs.,Client,depression,undefined
She thinks it will stunt my development.,Client,depression,undefined
Your boobs won't grow. You'll hate your body.,Client,depression,undefined
"You'll be deformed. That's all she cares about,",Client,depression,undefined
whether or not I grow a rack.,Client,depression,undefined
"So I won't have big boobs, who gives a flying fuck?",Client,disgust,undefined
"Must be pretty hard for you,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
trying to avoid your mom all the time.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Just the opposite.,Client,neutral,undefined
I enjoy it.,Client,neutral,undefined
Really? Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
A few minutes ago you said you had to run off to the gym,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
in order to be with her.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"How extraordinary, Dr. Freud. Whatever do you think I meant?",Client,joy,undefined
Maybe it means that...,Client,depression,undefined
"no matter what I do, I can't get rid of her.",Client,depression,undefined
"Maybe it means that,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in order to keep her interested in you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You feel you have to,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
run away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That doesn't even make sense.,Client,neutral,undefined
You sound like a fortune cookie.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you ever worn shoes like that before?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Oh yeah, all the time. I mean, don't you?",Client,depression,undefined
This type of heel raises your butt and shapes your calf.,Client,joy,undefined
And that's essential.,Client,joy,undefined
"I highly recommend you pick up a pair, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
Must remember to do that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
So why did you wear them last night?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Really? No idea?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They remind me of Dorothy's shoes.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Who's Dorothy?,Client,neutral,undefined
From The Wizard of Oz.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You said Dorothy like she was a friend of yours.,Client,neutral,undefined
They're nothing like Dorothy's shoes.,Client,joy,undefined
Dorothy was cool. Her shoes were retro.,Client,joy,undefined
"Oh, no.",Client,neutral,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Please don't say, there's no place like home.",Client,disgust,undefined
"'cause if you do, I might have to puke all over your sofa.",Client,disgust,undefined
"No, at the end, I was going to say that Dorothy discovers",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that she can go home anytime she wants,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
with or without her shoes.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why are you infantilizing me?,Client,anger,undefined
I apologize if--,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"If that's how it sounded, Sophie.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I really didn't intend that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"So, have you taken your S.A.T.s yet?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Not yet.,Client,disgust,undefined
I have a feeling that you're going to do really well.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I expect to.,Client,depression,undefined
"So,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"your mother bought you these shoes, you hate them and you still wore them.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm at a total loss.,Client,disgust,undefined
"But, hey,",Client,disgust,undefined
"why don't you call up my mother and say, Hi, Sophie's mom,",Client,disgust,undefined
"Sophie wore those Barbie shoes you bought her,",Client,disgust,undefined
"went out to a bar, screwed half the U.S. olympic team",Client,disgust,undefined
and now she's gonna kill herself.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why'd you do it anyway?,Client,depression,undefined
Why'd you call her?,Client,depression,undefined
Because I was worried about you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Suddenly everyone's so worried about me.,Client,depression,undefined
Did you call Cy too?,Client,disgust,undefined
He's turned into my grandmother. He won't let me train.,Client,depression,undefined
He's making me do classes with the 10-year-olds.,Client,depression,undefined
It's ridiculous.,Client,depression,undefined
Now I remember what I wanted to tell you.,Client,joy,undefined
The most amazing thing happened at the gym the other day.,Client,joy,undefined
"Even though I haven't been training,",Client,joy,undefined
I've been absorbing stuff just by watching.,Client,neutral,undefined
'Cause I have this chronic problem,Client,neutral,undefined
with my toes going off the edge of the beam when I land a hard element.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's because I'm naturally knock-kneed.,Client,neutral,undefined
"My knees, they face inwards.",Client,neutral,undefined
So in order to get them facing straight,Client,neutral,undefined
"my feet have to point out,",Client,neutral,undefined
which is good for ballet but bad for gymnastics.,Client,neutral,undefined
Just a toe in the wrong position can lose you the event.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm talking about medals here.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So anyway, i'm on the beam, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"And I've been training at nighttime,",Client,neutral,undefined
even though my body doesn't want to yet.,Client,neutral,undefined
It was like...,Client,depression,undefined
When I was little and I used to starve myself,Client,depression,undefined
"and there would be this period,",Client,depression,undefined
"usually in the morning, where",Client,depression,undefined
I was really really hungry.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, so hungry that I thought that my stomach might just start",Client,depression,undefined
eating the rest of me.,Client,depression,undefined
And then it would go away--,Client,neutral,undefined
Suddenly-- like turning off a light switch.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I felt like I was floating on clouds.,Client,joy,undefined
It was the same with the pain this time.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I pushed through it until it just let up,",Client,neutral,undefined
all of a sudden.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then I felt like I didn't have a body at all.,Client,neutral,undefined
Like I was just a pair of somersaulting eyes.,Client,joy,undefined
So yesterday I marched into the gym,Client,joy,undefined
and I got up on the beam.,Client,joy,undefined
Everyone was in shock and I felt this silence all around me.,Client,joy,undefined
"Sophie, be careful, please.",Therapist,neutral,Others
"Then something inside of me,",Client,joy,undefined
"some little voice said, prove it.",Client,joy,undefined
So I started the first element.,Client,joy,undefined
"Here, I'll show you.",Client,joy,undefined
"Sophie, please be careful.",Therapist,neutral,Others
This is dangerous.,Therapist,neutral,Others
"Don't have a cow, Paul. I'm fine.",Client,joy,undefined
"So anyway, I begin the first element.",Client,neutral,undefined
"When I look back at my feet, they were right on the beam.",Client,joy,undefined
"It's nothing major, but I took it as a sort of sign.",Client,joy,undefined
"Afterwards, everyone told me Cy was so shocked that he couldn't breathe.",Client,joy,undefined
"Well, I bet he was.",Therapist,neutral,Others
I did a backflip.,Client,joy,undefined
I landed perfectly.,Client,joy,undefined
That was incredible.,Therapist,joy,Approval
I just walked back to the bench like it was no big deal.,Client,joy,undefined
I could feel everybody's eyes on my back,Client,joy,undefined
I wanted to turn around and just...,Client,joy,undefined
And what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing.,Client,joy,undefined
"No, come on, tell me.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I wanted to flip them the bird with both hands,Client,joy,undefined
like Fuck all of you and the fish you swam in on.,Client,joy,undefined
I thought it was the...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The horse that you rode in on.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Not in my book.,Client,neutral,undefined
In my book it's a fish.,Client,neutral,undefined
"What is it, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
What's wrong?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't feel well.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you want some water?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you feel a pain?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Wait a second.,Client,depression,undefined
"Just wait, it'll go away.",Client,depression,undefined
"Stop it, Sophie.",Client,sadness,undefined
Stop it.,Client,sadness,undefined
What is it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Sophie, look at me.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Please.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What is it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What goes on in there?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Tell me.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Around 2:00 a.m., he took me to his room.",Client,depression,undefined
Who did?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The new guy with the Tequila.,Client,depression,undefined
"He's from Minnesota or Michigan or somewhere,",Client,depression,undefined
he's a brilliant gymnast.,Client,depression,undefined
"He wanted to have sex,",Client,disgust,undefined
he couldn't get it up.,Client,disgust,undefined
He was pretty wasted too.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then he did and then we had sex and,",Client,depression,undefined
I didn't feel anything.,Client,fear,undefined
As usual.,Client,fear,undefined
Absolutely nothing.,Client,fear,undefined
Afterwards he said that I fucked,Client,depression,undefined
like someone who's been sexually abused.,Client,depression,undefined
Prick.,Therapist,anger,Communication Skills
"I'm sorry, go on.",Therapist,anger,Communication Skills
"We went to the girls' house,",Client,depression,undefined
to the room that I sometimes stay in.,Client,depression,undefined
I tried to go to sleep but I couldn't stop thinking about what he'd said.,Client,depression,undefined
I was afraid that if I fell asleep,Client,depression,undefined
I wouldn't get up in time to come here so...,Client,depression,undefined
And when I closed my eyes I saw these horrible images.,Client,fear,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Like,",Client,fear,undefined
"everything around me was falling apart,",Client,fear,undefined
"you know, disintegrating,",Client,fear,undefined
turning into ash right in front of me.,Client,fear,undefined
I forced myself to think of something pretty and nice like,Client,fear,undefined
a pasture in the sunlight and to hold it there--,Client,fear,undefined
That image.,Client,fear,undefined
But as soon as I started to fall asleep,Client,fear,undefined
the pasture would turn to rot.,Client,fear,undefined
It was terrible.,Client,fear,undefined
That reminded me of the accident for some reason. I don't know why.,Client,fear,undefined
"I was scared that if I slept I'd dream about the accident,",Client,fear,undefined
So I got up and I walked to the bus stop,Client,sadness,undefined
"very slowly,",Client,sadness,undefined
"backwards actually,",Client,sadness,undefined
just to slow myself down.,Client,sadness,undefined
"The buses weren't running yet, so,",Client,sadness,undefined
I sat on the bench.,Client,sadness,undefined
Yeah?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
And what?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What were you thinking about when you sat on the bench?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was thinking about Dana.,Client,sadness,undefined
I couldn't breathe.,Client,sadness,undefined
"The night of the accident,",Client,sadness,undefined
"when I left Darlene's house and got on the bike,",Client,sadness,undefined
all of a sudden I couldn't breathe.,Client,sadness,undefined
My throat closed up.,Client,sadness,undefined
"There's this blind turn at the end of their hill, and when I,",Client,sadness,undefined
I went around it a white car almost hit me.,Client,sadness,undefined
I don't remember.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Go on, Sophie.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What happened with the car?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't remember.,Client,anger,undefined
"Go on, please. It's really important.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I don't remember anything else.,Client,anger,undefined
You don't have to do this alone.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't want to.,Client,anger,undefined
Go on.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
The seat was hurting me.,Client,disgust,undefined
"It was Cy's bike, a man's bike, so it had a narrow seat.",Client,disgust,undefined
That's why it was hurting me.,Client,disgust,undefined
When I reached the blind turn,Client,sadness,undefined
a white car came around and almost hit me.,Client,sadness,undefined
It had the brights on so it blinded me.,Client,sadness,undefined
It swerved away from me and then honked and--,Client,sadness,undefined
It was so weird.,Client,sadness,undefined
"The road just sort of started coming at me,",Client,sadness,undefined
"sort of attacking me really fast,",Client,sadness,undefined
"like I was falling from somewhere very high,",Client,sadness,undefined
And I wanted it.,Client,sadness,undefined
I wanted to hear a huge boom,Client,sadness,undefined
and then I wanted to hear nothing.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm trying to kill myself.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm a fucking freak.,Client,sadness,undefined
You're not a freak.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
What happened then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was as if it had already happened.,Client,sadness,undefined
As soon as the white car passed,Client,sadness,undefined
I knew I was going to have an accident.,Client,sadness,undefined
And I just felt calm.,Client,sadness,undefined
I turned the handlebars just the smallest little bit to the left.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I remember thinking,",Client,sadness,undefined
just this tiny little movement is enough.,Client,sadness,undefined
Then I rode into the street.,Client,depression,undefined
It was impossible for another car not to hit me.,Client,depression,undefined
And I felt just free--,Client,depression,undefined
Free and strong.,Client,depression,undefined
I had this adrenaline rush like nothing could touch me.,Client,depression,undefined
What is that about?,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe you felt like you were in control.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Yes.,Client,depression,undefined
Yeah?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
And then I was in the middle of the road,Client,sadness,undefined
there was this terrible screeching sound and then a boom.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I remember I said to myself, oh.",Client,sadness,undefined
Just oh.,Client,sadness,undefined
And I flew into the air.,Client,sadness,undefined
I could suddenly breathe again. I had all this air in my lungs.,Client,sadness,undefined
And then you were on the ground,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
you were lying there. Do you rember what--,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What was going through your head?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That I finally killed her.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Killed who, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's what I thought when I landed.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Who did you kill, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Laura, I think that",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
we need to discuss in a little greater detail,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
your ending therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"We're not stopping yet, but in order to do it gradually,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
we have to create what we call,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
a timeline.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
No timeline.,Client,neutral,undefined
We're finishing today.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, today. This is our last session.",Client,neutral,undefined
Good.,Client,joy,undefined
Feels good.,Client,joy,undefined
"Resolved, I guess.",Client,joy,undefined
"I was a little nervous about telling you but now that that's over, I feel better,",Client,neutral,undefined
"relieved,",Client,neutral,undefined
maybe a little tired.,Client,neutral,undefined
And...,Client,neutral,undefined
and sad. How about you?,Client,neutral,undefined
How do you feel?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm sorry, is that not okay for me to ask?",Client,joy,undefined
"No, it's perfectly okay.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Good, so...",Client,neutral,undefined
tell me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"to be honest, it's come as a bit of a shock.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Shock. Well, okay, what else?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I feel sad, too.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Right.,Client,joy,undefined
"Yes, I do. You don't believe me?",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It just doesn't look that way. It looks like you're,Client,joy,undefined
"holding back this huge sigh of relief,",Client,neutral,undefined
this,Client,neutral,undefined
huge gulp of air trapped in your lungs.,Client,neutral,undefined
"See, I'm trained to see that stuff, remember?",Client,joy,undefined
"Monitoring respiration, that's anesthesiology 101.",Client,joy,undefined
"Go ahead, let it go.",Client,neutral,undefined
Exhale.,Client,neutral,undefined
No?,Client,neutral,undefined
Well...,Client,neutral,undefined
maybe I'm a lousy Doctor.,Client,neutral,undefined
So how's your week been?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Don't ask me about my week. It was terrible.,Client,depression,undefined
How terrible?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was in surgery on friday and,Client,depression,undefined
"this 15-year-old girl, she",Client,depression,undefined
she had this tumor on her cheek.,Client,depression,undefined
"It was nothing, benign,",Client,depression,undefined
cosmetic.,Client,depression,undefined
"And everything's going great,",Client,depression,undefined
right? Nothing wrong with the anesthetic.,Client,depression,undefined
And my attending gets called away to consult on a procedure,Client,depression,undefined
and the surgery ended faster than normal.,Client,depression,undefined
It was simple.,Client,depression,undefined
And I'm left with her still anesthetized.,Client,depression,undefined
So I called to ask what to do.,Client,depression,undefined
I'd never been in that situation before with a patient who's never woken up.,Client,depression,undefined
And they told me to,Client,depression,undefined
take her into the recovery room.,Client,depression,undefined
"She was still intubated,",Client,depression,undefined
and the attending was supposed to remove the tube,Client,depression,undefined
when she wakes up.,Client,depression,undefined
"She was a sweet girl, Pretty.",Client,depression,undefined
Michelle was her name.,Client,depression,undefined
"Before the op, I was talking to her mom who told me that she'd Been",Client,depression,undefined
"asking for this operation since she was 9,",Client,depression,undefined
"they recommended that she put it off for a while,",Client,depression,undefined
"and how she wasn't afraid,",Client,depression,undefined
"just wanted this thing gone,",Client,disgust,undefined
this Fatty Lump off her Pretty face.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And then suddenly, she wasn't breathing. I don't know what happened, Paul.",Client,fear,undefined
"I took her into recovery and two minutes later she was blue. I mean,",Client,fear,undefined
"Atcheson, he's the",Client,disgust,undefined
"senior attending, he pushed me aside and pounced on her",Client,disgust,undefined
"with chest compressions. I had no idea what went wrong, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
"They extubated her, and she was breathing. Everything was fine.",Client,disgust,undefined
It was okay.,Client,disgust,undefined
How did you feel during those,Therapist,neutral,Open question
few minutes when the...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"fantastic, never better.",Client,joy,undefined
I felt,Client,depression,undefined
like shit.,Client,depression,undefined
"I only look competent, Paul, you know.",Client,joy,undefined
"White coat, stethoscope, pen in pocket.",Client,joy,undefined
"I'm like those Doctors from the pharmaceutical ads. You know, like,",Client,joy,undefined
"hand on hip,",Client,joy,undefined
"brow a little furrowed with concern,",Client,joy,undefined
"nice smile. I have a pretty smile, right?",Client,joy,undefined
"emhuh, Do...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you expect that nothing will ever go wrong with a patient?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I dropped the ball.,Client,depression,undefined
I dropped the ball.,Client,depression,undefined
But is that what the,Therapist,neutral,Open question
attending concluded?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, couldn't it have been something else, like,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I don't know an allergic reaction,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
a drop in blood.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's always my responsibility. Paul.,Client,depression,undefined
"Tell me a little bit more about that, about that girl.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She had braces.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And through her surgical cap, you could see.",Client,neutral,undefined
What do they call it?,Client,joy,undefined
"The barrettes, little butterflies pinning back her bangs.",Client,joy,undefined
They were old.,Client,neutral,undefined
Must have her mother's or,Client,neutral,undefined
from a thrift store or something.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And she had these beautiful hands,",Client,joy,undefined
"gorgeous hands. I mean, she's just a girl,",Client,joy,undefined
"and she had these hands of a woman,",Client,joy,undefined
"very long fingers, Pretty little nails.",Client,joy,undefined
"Shit, when I was her age I used to eat my nails.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, they were ugly and stubby and short.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Nerves, I guess.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why were you nervous?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, it was,",Client,disgust,undefined
"you know, around the time that my mother passed away, so...",Client,disgust,undefined
And whose responsibility were you then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What do you mean?,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, who was taking care of you?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You mean who was watching my sleep?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yeah.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I wasn't that girl on the operating table, Paul.",Client,joy,undefined
"No, it's just that you told me that when your mother died, that it was like",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
a kind of a death for you too.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, but you know what?",Client,neutral,undefined
Shit happens.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Life isn't fair. What are you going to do, sue god?",Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, who would you sue?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You.,Client,joy,undefined
"No, suing you wouldn't do me any good, either.",Client,joy,undefined
"That's my problem with psychology, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
"You dig and you dig and you uncover all sorts of truths about yourself,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and you touch on all sorts of painful places, but what good does it do, Paul?",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm serious. I'm not being cynical. What good does it do me today,Client,disgust,undefined
to know how much I suffered then?,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm sick of feeling sorry for myself.,Client,disgust,undefined
I fucking hate feeling sorry for myself. That's one of the things I hate.,Client,disgust,undefined
What else do you hate?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
There's a long list.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, for example.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Omelets.,Client,neutral,undefined
Omelets.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Omelets and all sort of eggs, but mostly omelets.",Client,depression,undefined
That's was the thing my father and I ate,Client,depression,undefined
the entire year after my mother passed away.,Client,depression,undefined
"I still have flashbacks, but from behind, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
I'm standing at the stove and I'm,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm breaking eggs into a frying pan. Everything's very quiet, no talking.",Client,depression,undefined
My dad's just sitting there,Client,depression,undefined
reading the news paper or something and I'm just...,Client,depression,undefined
beating the eggs with a fork.,Client,depression,undefined
Sometimes he wouldn't even be reading the newspaper. He would just be,Client,depression,undefined
"sitting there with a vacant look, in a daze.",Client,depression,undefined
I used to.,Client,depression,undefined
I'd fantasize that he'd disappear.,Client,disgust,undefined
Such a terrible thing to say. It's not that I wanted him to die.,Client,disgust,undefined
I just didn't want to continue living like that.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Everything was so bleak, so suffocating. I just didn't want to be there.",Client,disgust,undefined
em... So then...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Then you went to California.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you stayed there for a while.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How was it coming back home after spending that,Therapist,neutral,Open question
time with David and Celia?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, you know, you have plans,",Client,depression,undefined
full of beans.,Client,depression,undefined
"I thought, shit, I can make him feel better. I can.",Client,disgust,undefined
But I couldn't.,Client,disgust,undefined
That house was like a black hole that just,Client,disgust,undefined
sucked me in.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Anyway, I",Client,depression,undefined
I saw David again six months later.,Client,depression,undefined
Oh?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
He came to the DC area to try some big case.,Client,depression,undefined
"He was stayed for a while, a few months.",Client,depression,undefined
I thought you said you never saw him again.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I never saw them again, but I saw him.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He used to have a room at the <i>Hay-Adams</i>,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but occasionally, he'd stay over at our house.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He didn't have a car, so when it got late he'd stay.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He always offered to take a cab back into town,",Client,neutral,undefined
but my dad refused since he was...,Client,neutral,undefined
so hospitable to me during the summer.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, he was lonely.",Client,neutral,undefined
"But he wasn't the same David, you know,",Client,neutral,undefined
with the Ray-Bans and the sunblock and the surfboard.,Client,neutral,undefined
He was this lawyer guy with...,Client,neutral,undefined
"a three-piece suit, an expensive haircut",Client,neutral,undefined
"and a middle-aged pot belly,",Client,neutral,undefined
not that there's anything wrong with a pot belly.,Client,joy,undefined
"Anyway, he came to our house",Client,joy,undefined
for dinner the first night he was in town.,Client,joy,undefined

"What was that like, sitting there with...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"these extremes, your father on one side and...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nick Nolte with a pot belly sitting on the other side?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What was that like?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"At first,",Client,neutral,undefined
"self-conscious, I guess.",Client,neutral,undefined
You know how you always feel more like a kid,Client,neutral,undefined
when your parents are around? That happened.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I remember slurping up spaghetti,",Client,neutral,undefined
trying really hard not to let the noodles drip down my chin.,Client,joy,undefined
"Later, I guess, I wasn't as self-conscious.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Later, after David and I made love.",Client,depression,undefined
I seduced him.,Client,depression,undefined
Have you read <i>Lolita</i>?,Client,depression,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"It's amazing, because pretty much the same thing happened to me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"That night when he came over for dinner, my dad was still at work.",Client,depression,undefined
So we sat on the porch...,Client,depression,undefined
and caught up.,Client,depression,undefined
I was painting my toenails.,Client,joy,undefined
"And it became pretty clear that he and Celia were having problems,",Client,depression,undefined
"He said just as much, which is why she hadn't joined him on the trip.",Client,depression,undefined
So we were just sitting on the porch swing.,Client,depression,undefined
I was on one side. He was on the other.,Client,depression,undefined
And I was resting my...,Client,depression,undefined
legs on his to dry my nails.,Client,depression,undefined
"And he was just asking about me,",Client,joy,undefined
"what was going on with me, I started telling him about",Client,joy,undefined
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.,Client,joy,undefined
"God, I was so into them.",Client,joy,undefined
When you're writing down the lyrics,Client,joy,undefined
"and analyzing them,",Client,joy,undefined
and I started singing at the top of my lungs.,Client,joy,undefined
"And David joined in, we were so bad.",Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, we were screaming it.",Client,joy,undefined
And then I felt his hardness...,Client,depression,undefined
under my foot.,Client,depression,undefined
"And we we're just rocking in the swing,",Client,depression,undefined
the rhythm of it starts to take over.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I'm just rubbing him with my foot,",Client,joy,undefined
although I've never done that before in my life. Never.,Client,joy,undefined
I had on this little skirt with these little flowers.,Client,depression,undefined
And he pushed up my skirt with his finger.,Client,depression,undefined
And his finger just started...,Client,depression,undefined
climbing further and further up my thigh.,Client,depression,undefined
"Then we see my father's Volvo coming down the street,",Client,depression,undefined
so we ran over to help him,Client,depression,undefined
with the groceries. And I remember laughing so hard,Client,depression,undefined
because David was carrying his bag of groceries in front of his hard-on.,Client,joy,undefined
We were just cracking up like teenagers.,Client,joy,undefined
He stayed over that night in Oliver's room.,Client,depression,undefined
"Around 1:00 in the morning, I got up 'cause I couldn't sleep,",Client,depression,undefined
I walked down...,Client,depression,undefined
the corridor in the house. Oliver's room was at the back of the house.,Client,depression,undefined
And I saw his light on.,Client,depression,undefined
"The door was open, and he was waiting for me.",Client,depression,undefined
And we made love. It was lovely.,Client,depression,undefined
"During the two months he was in town,",Client,depression,undefined
"we made love almost every day, mostly in the mornings",Client,depression,undefined
"when my dad went to work, but occasionally,",Client,depression,undefined
"if he didn't have to be in court until the afternoon,",Client,depression,undefined
I'd play hooky.,Client,joy,undefined
Sometimes I'd go to his fancy hotel.,Client,joy,undefined
I felt very important and grown-up,Client,joy,undefined
walking through that lobby in my mother's high heels.,Client,joy,undefined
Did you ever feel that this man...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That David was taking advantage of you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He wasn't taking advantage of me. I'm telling you. I seduced him.,Client,neutral,undefined
Lolita seduces Humbert in the novel and she's only 12.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You disapprove, obviously.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, I do.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What's the matter? You're making a judgment on me.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're allowing yourself to stray from the rules.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Gosh, it's too bad you weren't like this before,",Client,neutral,undefined
willing to say what's on your mind.,Client,neutral,undefined
You never told me this before.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's our last session so I thought it was only right you to tell you.,Client,depression,undefined
Remember I told you that the guy from debate society was my first?,Client,depression,undefined
David was my first.,Client,depression,undefined
And I'm sorry.,Client,depression,undefined
What are you sorry for?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
For lying to you.,Client,depression,undefined
I wasn't a victim. Don't look at me like that.,Client,depression,undefined
I wasn't a victim.,Client,depression,undefined
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I got into his bed.,Client,depression,undefined
"He was a 40-year-old man, for Christ's sake.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He had a responsibility to send you away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He was very gentle.,Client,depression,undefined
"Gentle or not, it is beside the point. He was 40 years.",Therapist,anger,Interpretation
He had a moral responsibility. He should have known better.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
Let me ask you something.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you feel...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you feel any anger towards this man?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's not such a big deal.,Client,neutral,undefined
He didn't hurt me. It didn't hurt at all.,Client,neutral,undefined
It wasn't rape.,Client,neutral,undefined
Where was your father,Therapist,neutral,Open question
during all this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He was asleep in the next room.,Client,neutral,undefined
But during the two months that David was...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"visiting, your father had no idea what was going on?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
He was depressed and grieving.,Client,depression,undefined
It hadn't even been a year since my mother passed away.,Client,disgust,undefined
"He needed someone to protect him, and guess who?",Client,disgust,undefined
"I understand that,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but children aren't supposed to take care of their parents.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's a burden that no child deserves.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you feel any anger towards your father,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"for not being there to protect you,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
for not noticing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No resentment?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Okay, Let's just say you could talk to your father now.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
What would you say to him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I have nothing to say to him.,Client,depression,undefined
But just imagine for a moment if you were face to face,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and you were...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
talking about this incident.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What do you think you might say to him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Have you ever spoken to your father in that way?,Client,anger,undefined
I wish I could.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Because you can't talk to your father, you're asking me to talk to mine?",Client,anger,undefined
That's not what I'm saying.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think it's important,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
that you talk to your father about this,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"while it's still possible, not for his sake,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
but for yours.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Can I have something to drink other than water?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you have any soda?,Client,neutral,undefined
"So I'll open with the punchline, doc:",Client,neutral,undefined
I broke up with Laura.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was actually a pretty great fuck the second time.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I drank about a half bottle of Stoli,",Client,neutral,undefined
just to relax.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I also took a pill that Daniel gave me, you know,",Client,neutral,undefined
one of those.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I had a hard-on for a day and a half, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
You should try it sometime.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's a little strange, though.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's like a woody that actually feels like wood,Client,neutral,undefined
'cause it's just sitting up there and minding his own business,Client,neutral,undefined
like it's got nothing to do with you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Works like a charm, though.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, I made up for the last time.",Client,neutral,undefined
We were fucking.,Client,neutral,undefined
"All night long, in the morning too.",Client,neutral,undefined
In the end I realized that she was just using me.,Client,depression,undefined
She really wasn't with me. She was just,Client,depression,undefined
"using me for an excuse, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
"Yeah, at any rate, it's over.",Client,depression,undefined
It's really not gonna go anywhere from here.,Client,depression,undefined
"Excuse me, when you say from here, forgive me,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but do you mean from this office?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What?,Client,depression,undefined
Are you trying to say that your relationship with Laura,Therapist,neutral,Open question
has something to do with what goes on in this office?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Have you completely lost your mind? What are you grasping at now, a word?",Client,joy,undefined
"No, it's just that you're always trying to make this bizarre connection",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"between you, me and Laura.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is it me? Cause you're the one always making a big deal out of it.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tell me something didn't happen between you and her.,Client,joy,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You're asking me to tell you what didn't happen?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, I'm asking. Did something happen between you two or not?",Client,neutral,undefined
You mean apart from therapy?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Jesus, look at you dance. It's a simple question.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Your million-dollar technique,",Client,neutral,undefined
"answering a question with a question. Well, it ain't gonna fly this time.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'll tell you why I'm asking.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Every time we were together, half the time she talked about you.",Client,depression,undefined
She kept asking what I knew about you and your family.,Client,depression,undefined
She was pretty obsessive about it.,Client,depression,undefined
And I then I remembered how jumpy you get,Client,depression,undefined
every time I mention her name. So I thought maybe,Client,depression,undefined
"something went on between you. Maybe you,",Client,depression,undefined
a married man...,Client,depression,undefined
How should I put it?,Client,disgust,undefined
You fooled around with her.,Client,disgust,undefined
"What are you suggesting, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can you just say that nothing happened between you?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why is that so difficult?,Client,neutral,undefined
We've talked about this.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"I will only discuss your relationship with Laura,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Nothing else.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Sweet. So you discuss mine, but not yours.",Client,disgust,undefined
The point I'm trying to make is that my,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
other patients have nothing to do with your therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Excuse me. You having sex,Client,neutral,undefined
with somebody I'm dating sounds very relevant to my therapy.,Client,neutral,undefined
She said she was having sex with me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Didn't have to.,Client,disgust,undefined
You're convinced that she did.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm just asking.,Client,depression,undefined
The only relevant thing is how you feel about the possibility,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
of laura having sex with somebody other than yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Don't start with your asinine shit. You're copping out.,Client,disgust,undefined
Would you stop trying to force me into this relationship you've concocted?,Therapist,anger,Open question
Why in the hell would I do that?,Client,disgust,undefined
Maybe you want to compete with me.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
"Maybe it's like the coffee, the check, your intelligence.",Therapist,anger,Interpretation
"If I'm not mistaken, I'm paying to talk. This is what I want to talk about...",Client,neutral,undefined
"You and laura, and I'd like a straight answer for a change.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Have you noticed when an emotional issue comes up for you, you focus on money?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I have a different theory, though, cause every time we touch",Client,neutral,undefined

"I have a different theory, though, cause every time we touch",Client,neutral,undefined
"on something that has to do with you, you get scared shitless.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why would I be scared about talking about myself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Because you want your patients to think you're superhuman,",Client,neutral,undefined
you're a buddha.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You don't eat, you don't shit, you don't piss.",Client,neutral,undefined
You don't argue with your wife. You don't fantasize about your patients.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, you're above all of these earthly things,",Client,disgust,undefined
because you live only for your patients.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Your private life doesn't matter, only this inner sanctum.",Client,disgust,undefined
Why are you giving me that look?,Client,neutral,undefined
What look? It's the way I look.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, that look like you know everything,",Client,depression,undefined
like you can see right through me.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe like the old man in Baghdad?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Oh, fuck.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Now you'll say you want to talk about my father, right?",Client,joy,undefined
"Okay, would you like to talk about your father?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You people love this shit.,Client,joy,undefined
This is right in your wheelhouse. You wanna talk about my father?,Client,joy,undefined
"Go ahead, fire away.",Client,joy,undefined
Ask me whatever you want.,Client,joy,undefined
"But he is an amazing man, my dad.",Client,neutral,undefined
He really is.,Client,neutral,undefined
But that's not what you told me last week.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"He's a good man, okay?",Client,depression,undefined
There's nothing you or 200 shrinks can change.,Client,depression,undefined
"Let's put aside for the moment whether he's a good man or a bad man, okay?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What interests me is how you feel about him,Therapist,neutral,Open question
and what your relationship with him is like.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"When I say he's an amazing man, i'm talking about facts, not feelings.",Client,neutral,undefined
Would you say that to...,Client,disgust,undefined
a girl who was raped by her father in third grade?,Client,disgust,undefined
"You're not interested in good or bad,",Client,disgust,undefined
You're only interested in how she feels about the relationship?,Client,disgust,undefined
When did good or bad go out of style?,Client,disgust,undefined
"That reference to the girl being raped by her father,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
where does that come from?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can we go back to last week?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"If I rember correctly, you described your father as being",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
an unfaithful man.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said that he was ungrateful.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"He treated your mother really terribly,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but that at the same time you...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"had a great admiration for him. That's correct, yes?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"It seems to me that your feelings about your father,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"alex, are pretty conflicted.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You don't get what I said at all.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, maybe you could...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
explain it to me a little bit more.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Fuck that, it's no use.",Client,depression,undefined
You're gonna hear what you wanna hear.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you and your dad talk a lot?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, we talk, as much as is necessary.",Client,disgust,undefined
"What does that mean, as much as is necessary?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't understand that question.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, who calls who?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
We talk as much as possible. He's not a chatterbox.,Client,depression,undefined
"He's precise, you know? He's to the point, boom.",Client,depression,undefined
He cuts straight to the heart of things.,Client,depression,undefined
"He's like iron, my dad, cast iron.",Client,depression,undefined
"Iron in everything he does, his movement, everything...",Client,depression,undefined
"The way he works, the way he thinks, his wisdom.",Client,depression,undefined
I don't think there's a book he hasn't read.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm talking real literature, doc...",Client,depression,undefined
"History, political science...",Client,depression,undefined
Everything. The man is 70 years old,Client,depression,undefined
and he works like he did 30 years ago.,Client,depression,undefined
He's as healthy as a horse. He can still beat me in arm wrestling.,Client,depression,undefined
He's iron.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, when I think of iron, I tend to think of something that's...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"really indestructible, that's...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"incredibly powerful, strong.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And yet at the same time something that's kind of cold.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"How do you feel about what I did,",Client,depression,undefined
"killing people, dropping the bomb on themadrassa?",Client,depression,undefined
Why are you going back to that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Simple question, doc.",Client,joy,undefined
It's about your main thing... Feelings. How do you feel...,Client,joy,undefined
about what I did when I dropped a bomb on 16 kids?,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not here to judge you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm not asking for a judgment.,Client,depression,undefined
"I wanna know, how do you feel?",Client,depression,undefined
How do I feel?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, I think it must be very difficult for you",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
to live with what happened.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
: What?,Client,joy,undefined
You have made an art,Client,neutral,undefined
and a science and a career out of taking the easy position.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Do you really think not judging you is easy, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Let me tell you something: It's not.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why can't you just say you think I'm a murderer?,Client,neutral,undefined
Because I know that's what you think.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know that's what you talk about,Client,depression,undefined
when you're out with your friends at some fancy restaurant.,Client,depression,undefined
"You sit around the table, and you say, It's terrible. It's awful.",Client,depression,undefined
It's a massacre.,Client,depression,undefined

What it does to us... Let me tell you something:,Client,depression,undefined
I come here,Client,disgust,undefined
and I put my trust in you.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why can't you be honest enough,Client,disgust,undefined
to just tell me how you feel?,Client,disgust,undefined
You know what my father said when I told him about the mission?,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's what he said.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know what? That was the smartest reaction I got from anybody,",Client,depression,undefined
including you and all the other bleeding hearts.,Client,depression,undefined
'Cause there's nothing to say. What are you gonna say?,Client,disgust,undefined
Some things can't be explained away.,Client,disgust,undefined
Sometimes you can't peel away something and find...,Client,disgust,undefined
"It's just as plain as can be. 16 kids buried,",Client,disgust,undefined
dead under a building. That's it.,Client,disgust,undefined
"My father had it right, the old man. You gotta be like that.",Client,depression,undefined
"You gotta be like iron, baby.",Client,depression,undefined
It must be difficult for you to have lived in the shadow,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

To be like iron all the time.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You see how you twist things around?,Client,depression,undefined
"Am I ever gonna get out of this alive? If I said he was a pussy,",Client,depression,undefined
"you'd have a comment about that. If I said he was a hero,",Client,depression,undefined
you'd have a comment about that.,Client,depression,undefined
You love to sit here.,Client,depression,undefined
You listen to people's problems so you can probably sit on your porch,Client,depression,undefined
at the end of the day and just tell yourself...,Client,depression,undefined
My life is so great.,Client,depression,undefined
Can we stay focused on what the issue is we're trying to deal with here?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
The difficulty that you must have had,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

in a world where you're not allowed to express...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
who you are.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"your tender side, maybe your feminine side, for example.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So what do you do?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The only thing you can do is defy him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You have to fight with everything you have.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But you know something, alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You haven't done that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You haven't dared to do that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Your father is such a powerful, imposing character",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

"So you come through this door with all your rage,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

your buried anger toward him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You bring it in here and you let it loose on me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"That's what you do, but that's okay.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's fine. That's why I'm here.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think that's the most patronizing thing I've ever heard.,Client,depression,undefined

"It's fine, really.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I apologize.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Jesus, look, look at you.",Client,disgust,undefined
Look at how stressed you get thinking I might learn the slightest detail,Client,disgust,undefined
about your life. So what? You got a wife at home.,Client,disgust,undefined
Big deal.,Client,disgust,undefined
"See, that's the real problem with all your theories, paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
"They completely ignore your side of the whole equation,",Client,anger,undefined
that you are also human.,Client,anger,undefined
"Yeah, you have this nice theory that I see you as my father",Client,depression,undefined
and that's why I want to...,Client,depression,undefined
What did you say? Defy you.,Client,depression,undefined
But what about you? Why do you keep making it seem as if,Client,disgust,undefined
"you have no personal stake in this, as if you're only here for me?",Client,disgust,undefined
"It's a deception, paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Let's take Laura, for example.",Client,disgust,undefined
"You play such a big role in her life, it's unbelievable.",Client,disgust,undefined
She knows nothing about you.,Client,disgust,undefined
She's sure you're one of the most perfect people she's ever met,Client,disgust,undefined
"and she hasn't the faintest idea of who you are,",Client,disgust,undefined
"what your beliefs are, how long you've been married... Nothing!",Client,disgust,undefined
Doesn't it just seem a little insane to you?,Client,anger,undefined
Who are you?,Client,anger,undefined
Really?,Client,anger,undefined
I know the whole truth about you.,Client,depression,undefined
"You're not made of iron, that's for damn sure.",Client,depression,undefined
Not even close.,Client,depression,undefined

You...,Client,disgust,undefined
Really are perverted.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You know that she's young enough to be your daughter, man.",Client,disgust,undefined
During all our sessions here Ibet you sit here,Client,disgust,undefined

Right?,Client,disgust,undefined
You trying to make me angry?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Hey, don't try to turn this into my psychosis. I'm onto your shit.",Client,anger,undefined
But you're the one in therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're the one not telling the truth.,Client,anger,undefined
You're the one who's bullshitting me. You're the hypocrite.,Client,anger,undefined
I come in here every week and I tell you everything.,Client,anger,undefined
Now you can't look me in the eye and admit that you are falling in love,Client,anger,undefined
with a patient 20 years younger than you.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, come on. You can't hang with her.",Client,anger,undefined
"Come on, look at you.",Client,anger,undefined
You'll look like a fool.,Client,depression,undefined
Trust me. You can't keep up with her pace.,Client,depression,undefined
I can tell you that.,Client,depression,undefined
Let me ask you something:,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why did you have to sleep with her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. I got tired of jerking off.,Client,depression,undefined

The whole world revolves around your ass?,Client,disgust,undefined
I understand your theory.,Client,disgust,undefined
You've been hinting at it for the last 3 sessions.,Client,disgust,undefined
That ain't flying either.,Client,disgust,undefined
You really think that everything that happened between me and her,Client,disgust,undefined
was meant to hurt you?,Client,disgust,undefined
You did it to provoke me.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
"Maybe you were looking for a reaction, some kind of reaction,",Therapist,anger,Interpretation
anything more than a pat on the thigh.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
"Something emotional, even if it's anger.",Therapist,anger,Interpretation
That's interesting.,Client,depression,undefined

"When you say all, Who would you be referring to?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You and the rest of the world.,Client,depression,undefined
Listen. I realize I threaten you...,Client,depression,undefined
And that's where your aggression comes from.,Client,depression,undefined
"So in what way do you threaten us, you think?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You consider me a murderer.,Client,depression,undefined
The last couple of weeks,Client,depression,undefined
I've been trying to figure out...,Client,depression,undefined
"When people look in my eyes,",Client,depression,undefined
"look at my hands, can they tell",Client,depression,undefined
that I've killed 42 people,Client,depression,undefined
In the past 20 years?,Client,depression,undefined
That's 42 human beings.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You can't hide something like that, right?",Client,disgust,undefined
There's something about me... They've gotta see that.,Client,disgust,undefined
And it scares them.,Client,disgust,undefined
"So do you think that there is something about you,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
xomething obvious that people see?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You probably wanted to strangle me,Client,disgust,undefined
the first time I walked through that door.,Client,disgust,undefined
"In the last session, you finally got a chance",Client,disgust,undefined
to show your hatred for people like me.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I think maybe that's how you see yourself, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe that's why you pushed me,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to such a violent place.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So that I'd treat you the way that,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You think you should be treated.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Let me remind you, you attacked me.",Client,neutral,undefined
So what did you feel,Therapist,neutral,Open question
When I attacked you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What did I feel?,Client,neutral,undefined
A slight tremor in the wing.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's it.,Client,neutral,undefined
So no big deal.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
No big deal.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But, alex, I pushed you against the bookcase.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I threw coffee in your face.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm just curious. What happened in your body?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What was going through your head?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Hold on. I just realized something.,Client,neutral,undefined
You haven't apologized yet.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Before anything else, you're supposed to say",Client,neutral,undefined
I apologize. I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I've been here five minutes, and I got nothing from you.",Client,neutral,undefined
You're right.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You're absolutely right.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I apologize.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It should not have happened.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But... I felt,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
very offended by what you said.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Offended?,Client,neutral,undefined
No. That's not part of the deal.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I can say whatever the hell I want in here.",Client,neutral,undefined
That's the point of going to a shrink. You want me to censor every sentence,Client,neutral,undefined
or keep wondering if what I say might hurt you?,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's still like a relationship, alex. There are boundaries.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I felt that you were out to hurt me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And I... was,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
very hurt.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What offended you so much?,Client,neutral,undefined
"It was all true, wasn't it?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, you invaded my privacy.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You talked about the people I love,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you spoke about them with contempt,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and with what I felt was,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
deliberate cruelty.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Okay, So I guess my therapy is over...",Client,neutral,undefined
"Now, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"That's not what I said, alex.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, but it's what you think.",Client,neutral,undefined
You're tired of taking the shit I give you all the time,Client,depression,undefined
"And actually, I don't blame you.",Client,depression,undefined
"If I were you, i'd have gotten rid of me a long time ago.",Client,depression,undefined
So is that why you say those things?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"In the hopes that I would... What? Run away, kick you out?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"It's not gonna happen, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You guys really do live in a bubble. You live in this world, you don't...",Client,joy,undefined
It's all theories. You don't engage. You...,Client,joy,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Finish that thought. What were you going to say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I just remembered this dream I had.",Client,depression,undefined
"I was on the ground, and I was driving this little car",Client,depression,undefined
on the Iraqi international airport highway.,Client,depression,undefined
They call it the highway to hell.,Client,depression,undefined
And all of a sudden I'm in Baghdad,Client,depression,undefined
in this traffic jam. Above my head,Client,depression,undefined
I see this enemy plane. It's a Czech mig.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm not sure what it is exactly, but this mig is being followed",Client,depression,undefined
"by one of our jets, an f-16.",Client,depression,undefined
"Everyone's looking up, watching.",Client,depression,undefined
"And I say to myself,",Client,depression,undefined
Why isn't he shooting?,Client,depression,undefined
Why doesn't he blow him out of the sky?,Client,depression,undefined
"Now maybe he's afraid all the debris will fall on the people below,",Client,depression,undefined
But I know in the dream the orders are to take that fucker down.,Client,depression,undefined
"So they're flying real close like this and maneuvering,",Client,depression,undefined
And our guy doesn't launch.,Client,depression,undefined
And the enemy plane is getting away and it's driving me crazy.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, shit, he's on his way to our base camp.",Client,depression,undefined
"All the people on the ground below,",Client,depression,undefined
"They're waitg for him to take the mig down, and they're bloodthirsty.",Client,depression,undefined
And it doesn't happen.,Client,depression,undefined
They just fly away.,Client,depression,undefined
And that's it.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think you would have done better if you'd been up there?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Shit.,Client,neutral,undefined
Any pilot worth his salt would have blown that asshole,Client,neutral,undefined
to kingdom come.,Client,neutral,undefined
And who is the pilot?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe it's me. I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're the one who can't shoot?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
"Maybe because the other guy, the other pilot,",Client,depression,undefined
Is not that dangerous. I knew that.,Client,depression,undefined
He's only...,Client,depression,undefined
What? He's only what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Who's sitting in the plane?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Who's sitting in the enemy plane that you refuse to shoot down?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know who's there. I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
"Who is the enemy, alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Hey, stop, man.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Jeez, when you want to pressure, you pressure.",Client,disgust,undefined
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
Who's my enemy? You?,Client,depression,undefined
Is that how it feels?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, it's not you. You're not there.",Client,depression,undefined
Maybe it's my father.,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Client,depression,undefined
"What? You know the answer, but you don't wanna...",Client,depression,undefined
You want me to come up with it.,Client,depression,undefined
"No, it's just a dream.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm just helping you to look at it. That's all.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Okay, well, then you must have some chart or something around here",Client,depression,undefined
telling you what every part of a dream represents in reality.,Client,depression,undefined
"No, not really. Sometimes a number of images",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
can represent the same thing.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So it's me?,Client,disgust,undefined
"That's what you're saying, right? That I was the enemy pilot?",Client,disgust,undefined
I'm my own enemy?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Look, it's not clear actually that he's even an enemy.",Client,disgust,undefined
It's not that he doesn't have identification marks on the plane.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm just not familiar with it.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know for sure.,Client,depression,undefined
But he is trying to get away from you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"What do you think of this guy,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"This pilot, this fleeing pilot?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think he's a fucking coward.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Oh, yeah. What else?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
He's not a man.,Client,disgust,undefined
"He's running away like a pussy instead of turning around,",Client,disgust,undefined
standing his ground and fighting.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm dying to come up to that pitiful fucker,Client,anger,undefined
and shove an air-to-air missile up his rear burner.,Client,anger,undefined
What're you thinking?,Client,depression,undefined
Just say it.,Client,depression,undefined
You think I'm a faggot?,Client,neutral,undefined
That would go right along with all my father's theories.,Client,neutral,undefined
Only girls and fags see a shrink.,Client,neutral,undefined
So what if i'm a fag?,Client,joy,undefined
You said it very clearly before.,Client,disgust,undefined
Did i?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, maybe you didn't say it, but you've been leading me there.",Client,disgust,undefined
I have?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You're dying to say it's a homosexual dream.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm tailing him.,Client,disgust,undefined
I see fire coming out of his back burner.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm wanna shove my...,Client,disgust,undefined
"It all fits, doesn't it?",Client,depression,undefined
Even daniel never suspected it.,Client,depression,undefined
That could explain a lot of things.,Client,depression,undefined
What things?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Laura, for instance.",Client,depression,undefined
That lousy fuck we had the first time.,Client,depression,undefined
And Michaela.,Client,depression,undefined
The fact that i'm suddenly not attracted to her anymore.,Client,depression,undefined
"We saw each other this week at a restaurant,",Client,depression,undefined
and she wants me to come back home and thought it'd be better If we...,Client,depression,undefined
talked to each other in person.,Client,depression,undefined
"She was driving hard, man,",Client,depression,undefined
"Just on a mission, just on the attack.",Client,depression,undefined
She wanted us to start off by getting a room asap.,Client,disgust,undefined
There's that hotel above the restaurant. I said I couldn't.,Client,disgust,undefined
I couldn't.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I told her I had somewhere to be,",Client,depression,undefined
That we would do it another time.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, I really did have something else to do that night.",Client,depression,undefined
I was supposed to go with daniel and his...,Client,depression,undefined
his partner Sean to a party.,Client,depression,undefined
You understand this amazing woman wants to fuck the shit out of me,Client,disgust,undefined
in a 5-star hotel and instead I'm going to Georgetown with these two fags.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you understand that?,Client,disgust,undefined
And why do you think,Therapist,neutral,Open question
you'd rather spend time with them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Everything's a joke with them.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know if you're familiar with their world, but their humor",Client,neutral,undefined
"is in seeing everything from the outside like they're not a part of it,",Client,neutral,undefined
Like... Like they're above it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And by they, you mean homosexuals?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, especially Sean's crowd. I mean, he's genuinely queer.",Client,neutral,undefined
He's not the kind that's in conflict with himself,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, he's... This... Sean is immune to tension,",Client,joy,undefined
He's happy. He's happy all the time.,Client,joy,undefined
He just has no subconscious.,Client,neutral,undefined
Everything is right out in the open.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that something that...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is that something that you envy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They don't pressure me.,Client,neutral,undefined
They give you shit,Client,neutral,undefined
"to provoke you, and they love that shit, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, Sean asked me,",Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you always desperately,Client,depression,undefined
try to please everybody all the time?,Client,depression,undefined
God and country... Everybody?,Client,depression,undefined
"But it's bullshit. With them, they don't care. They really don't care.",Client,joy,undefined
They don't demand of me to be anything... extra.,Client,joy,undefined
"That night we got home about 4:00 a.m.,",Client,neutral,undefined
"And daniel went to the bedroom,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Sean and I stayed out in the livin room. He got a dvd, some gay porn thing.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, I don't know if he was trying to provoke me or what.",Client,neutral,undefined
He even suggested afterwards that i'd be ready for bed.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He said it jokingly, but he wasn't playing.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He told me once,",Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't know the meaning of life,Client,joy,undefined
until I got fucked in the ass.,Client,joy,undefined
"I once read that, psychologically, water symbolizes emotions.",Client,neutral,undefined
I wonder what your collection of boats says about you.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know. Maybe that i'm an emotional wreck.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Maybe you want to go out to sea,",Client,neutral,undefined
But you don't.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You mean that i want to express my feelings, but I can't.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"My father's a lifetime democrat,",Client,neutral,undefined
A war protester.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I knew that if I joined the navy,",Client,joy,undefined
It would piss him off.,Client,joy,undefined
"So fuck it, I went R.O.T.C. in high school,",Client,joy,undefined
and then i got my wings.,Client,joy,undefined
He couldn't tell me shit.,Client,joy,undefined
I remember the first time you were here. You said that...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"That you didn't chose to be a pilot,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that life chose it for you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I don't know about that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I think maybe you did choose that path,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And that you did it to defy your father.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He wanted me to be hard.,Client,depression,undefined
There's nothing harder than a topgun grad.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yeah, but, that's still a reaction to him.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's not your desire.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't think you're in touch with what you really want.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What I really want? What are you saying?,Client,disgust,undefined
What I really wanted was to be something else?,Client,disgust,undefined
Gay?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Have you ever been attracted to men, alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Ever had a sexual fantasy about a man?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I have never, no.",Client,disgust,undefined
"So when you say the word gay, what do you mean by that?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know. Don't take me there, man.",Client,depression,undefined
"This, saying what you think all the time... That's gay.",Client,depression,undefined
"Those guys, they have no filters.",Client,depression,undefined
What else?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Talking about your feelings all the time.,Client,depression,undefined
"So what you do here, for example, the way you interact with me,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Your father said... He said that anybody who goes to a shrink,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
is a... is a fag.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How did you get on with your dad when you were a kid?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I remember as a kid,Client,neutral,undefined
my father taking me to a church.,Client,neutral,undefined
This was the riverside church up in Harlem.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And back in those days, i lived kind of a double life.",Client,neutral,undefined
"During the week, i went to this all-boys private school.",Client,neutral,undefined
"It was elite,",Client,neutral,undefined
the finest teachers.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It was... the best, right?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Right.,Client,joy,undefined
It was also a totally sheltered environment.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So on the weekend, my dad would take me to all these",Client,neutral,undefined
"real rough ghetto areas,",Client,neutral,undefined
to places where he volunteered his time and money.,Client,neutral,undefined
He wanted to make sure that I knew how lucky I was,Client,neutral,undefined
"to live my little soft, cushy life.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I dreaded those fucking weekends, hated them.",Client,disgust,undefined
It's like he was always trying to test me.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Anyway, the riverside church had this athletic program that my dad supported.",Client,depression,undefined
"He needed to talk to the guy that ran the place, so they told me,",Client,depression,undefined
"You wait outside, shoot some baskets.",Client,depression,undefined
So it's early and the courts are deserted.,Client,depression,undefined
"And it's a bad area,",Client,depression,undefined
"But long story short, this kid comes up. He's about...",Client,depression,undefined
I don't know... He's 14.,Client,depression,undefined
And he beat the hell out of me.,Client,depression,undefined
He kicked me in the head a few times.,Client,depression,undefined
"He had this box cutter, I thought he was gonna slice my face.",Client,depression,undefined
But he wound up taking some little bullshit chain I had and...,Client,depression,undefined
"my sneakers... He took my sneakers, took my socks, and...",Client,depression,undefined
even took this little half-full pack of chewing gum.,Client,depression,undefined
And...,Client,depression,undefined
I went upstairs,Client,depression,undefined
"and my dad sees me, and he sees I just got my ass kicked,",Client,depression,undefined
"That I got no sneakers, no socks.",Client,depression,undefined
And I started to tell him what happened.,Client,depression,undefined
And I started crying.,Client,depression,undefined
So my dad...,Client,depression,undefined
slapped the shit out of me...,Client,depression,undefined
Sounded like a whip crack.,Client,depression,undefined
And he made me walk around barefoot,Client,depression,undefined
for the whole rest of the day,Client,depression,undefined
just to teach me a lesson.,Client,depression,undefined
What age were you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
11,Client,depression,undefined
"The next weekend, he took me to a gym",Client,depression,undefined
to meet up with this guy named tom.,Client,depression,undefined
And tom said that there are two types of martial arts.,Client,depression,undefined
"One is the kind that's a physical and spiritual discipline,",Client,depression,undefined
a way of life. The second type,Client,depression,undefined
"is where you learn to fight,",Client,depression,undefined
And this here is a fighting gym.,Client,depression,undefined
You got a problem with that?,Client,depression,undefined
"I didn't have a problem with it, 'cause I didn't want anybody",Client,depression,undefined
to ever put their hands on me like that ever again.,Client,depression,undefined
"So I came four days a week after school,",Client,disgust,undefined
"and I learned, and I learned fast.",Client,disgust,undefined
"And the next time some kid picked on me,",Client,disgust,undefined
I beat his face to a pulp.,Client,disgust,undefined
You couldn't even recognize him.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Cause, see, fear is like fire.",Client,sadness,undefined
"If you master it, then it can heat your house, cook your food,",Client,sadness,undefined
"But if it gets the best of you, it can burn you. It can destroy you.",Client,sadness,undefined
You control your fear...,Client,sadness,undefined
"You control your fear, you control your life.",Client,sadness,undefined
Excuse me.,Client,sadness,undefined
Are you allright?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah, I don't think I can do this.",Client,depression,undefined
Do what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"This therapy, I.. It...",Client,depression,undefined
That's just it's too much for me.,Client,depression,undefined
I think I need a break of... A few weeks or months.,Client,depression,undefined
"Just don't think it's leading anywhere, that's all.",Client,depression,undefined
It's not leading anywhere.,Client,depression,undefined
"Where do you want it to lead, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Someplace where I feel less shitty about myself.,Client,sadness,undefined
So at least where I could find some balance in my life.,Client,sadness,undefined
Some place sane. I miss flying.,Client,sadness,undefined
Somehow everything is just much simpler up there.,Client,sadness,undefined
I can focus on something. The only thing you have to think about is the mission.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's quiet.,Client,sadness,undefined
Is it possible to get that feeling,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"on the ground, do you think?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,sadness,undefined
"You know, I got a call from my wing commander, he's...",Client,depression,undefined
he's interested in knowing how I'm doing.,Client,depression,undefined
"He's fishing, he's trying to figure out if I'm ready.",Client,depression,undefined
For active duty.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, he said, It's all sorts of tests, Alex, it's a long process.",Client,depression,undefined
"Do you think you're ready for that, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
What do you think?,Client,depression,undefined
"No, I don't think you're ready.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe I can discuss it with Michaela.,Client,depression,undefined
"I don't think Sean and Daniel would be much help, 'cause they...",Client,depression,undefined
Gays don't really understand military.,Client,depression,undefined
Or vice versa.,Client,depression,undefined
"Alex, these feelings",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"and memories that you have about your father,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I think,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
this is really something we should...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
we should come back to.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"I might actually have to go in over the next few weeks,",Client,neutral,undefined
some days for some meetings and...,Client,neutral,undefined
So I keep you posted if I can't come newt week.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Thanks.,Client,neutral,undefined
Want some?,Client,joy,undefined
"No, I'm okay, thanks.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I was on the bus and I realized I haven't had anything to eat.,Client,joy,undefined
"So I sent a text message to Google from my phone,",Client,joy,undefined
they sent me back the number of this place near you.,Client,joy,undefined
Google can do that?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Google can do anything.,Client,neutral,undefined
You sure you don't want some? I think this place is totally organic.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No. Honestly, I'm sure.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I had lunch already.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How is it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's all right.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Not the best, but I have to eat.",Client,neutral,undefined
I need the calories.,Client,neutral,undefined
How was your week?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Good, thanks.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So you're in a good mood?,Client,neutral,undefined
I think so.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Do my moods worry you?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You were a little grumpy last week.,Client,joy,undefined
You sort of ate me alive.,Client,joy,undefined
There were a couple of points that I really wanted to make clear.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"And if I came across as impatient or abrupt,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I apologize.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Apology accepted. Were you having a bad week?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yeah.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
And...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Maybe some of that spilled over into this room.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
It happens sometimes. I wish it didn't.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Relax, I can take it.",Client,joy,undefined
Plus I like that side of you.,Client,joy,undefined
Which side?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The no-bullshit side.,Client,neutral,undefined
What did you mean when you said I need the calories?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I've lost some weight.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've lost some weight.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When you go back into training with weights and stuff,",Client,neutral,undefined
"As you build up muscle, you're supposed to gain weight",Client,neutral,undefined
because muscle weighs more than fat.,Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't know.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"When I'm not here, do you just bury your head under a rock or something?",Client,joy,undefined
"So these pounds that I've put on, they could be muscle, really.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you go to the gym?,Client,joy,undefined
Occasionally.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You have to do it consistently if you wanna see results.,Client,joy,undefined
Every day. Weights and cardio.,Client,joy,undefined
"No pain, no gain, guy.",Client,joy,undefined
You're right.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You can't see muscle,Client,neutral,undefined
"if it's buried under fat, so you have to reduce your sugar and carb intake.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, coach.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Sorry.,Client,joy,undefined
"No, I appreciate the tip, thanks.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Anyway,",Client,neutral,undefined
"If you build muscle, you'll gain weight,",Client,neutral,undefined
Unless of course you're a physiological freak like me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Since I've started lifting weights I've lost two pounds,",Client,neutral,undefined
Which is like anatomically impossible.,Client,neutral,undefined
Now Cy won't let me lift until I gain it back.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's bullshit, really.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He was like, you have to make sure that you eat protein",Client,neutral,undefined
"after every session, and you have to make sure that your fat-carb ratio,",Client,neutral,undefined
blah blah blah...,Client,neutral,undefined
He weighed me two days ago.,Client,joy,undefined
"I don't know how, but I lost another pound.",Client,joy,undefined
Can I eat here?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sorry?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I never asked if it was okay for me to eat here.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sure, of course it is.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I know you've all these rules.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wasn't sure if there was one about food.,Client,neutral,undefined
What are my rules?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Well...,Client,neutral,undefined
We made a no-suicide rule last week.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I think that was more of a pact, but...",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"If it was a pact, we'd be drinking poisoned Kool-Aid together.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And when I had the cast, you had that rule about not undressing me.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know that's so much a rule.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I felt that was inappropriate.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
So there are no rules.,Client,neutral,undefined
I can do whatever I want?,Client,joy,undefined
"No, that's not what I said,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
But you can definitely eat.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"It makes me happy to see you eat,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
with gusto.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"A lot of gusto, actually.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
What happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm done.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't want anymore. It's a bit disgusting.,Client,neutral,undefined
I thought you said it was good.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I said it was okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not hungry anymore.,Client,neutral,undefined
I had half a slice. What do you want me to do?,Client,disgust,undefined
Finish the whole thing? Who could finish a whole slice of pizza?,Client,disgust,undefined
Lots of people who could finish.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Fat people.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you know what <i>gusto</i> means?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Of course, it means...",Client,neutral,undefined
It means it's how fat people eat.,Client,neutral,undefined
With <i>gusto</i>.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you know a fat person who ate with <i>gusto</i>?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not exactly.,Client,joy,undefined
Why are you smiling?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
My father had this girlfriend...,Client,neutral,undefined
A model.,Client,neutral,undefined
She hardly spoke English,Client,neutral,undefined
and he didn't speak Italian. It was ridiculous.,Client,neutral,undefined
She used to turn up at his apartment with bags of chocolate.,Client,neutral,undefined
She kept trying to force-feed me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When I wouldn't do it, she told my dad I was anorexic.",Client,neutral,undefined
"She went around the house pointing to me and saying,",Client,neutral,undefined
I am so worried for her.,Client,joy,undefined
She has no <i>gusto</i> for eating.,Client,joy,undefined
Meanwhile she's stuffing her bony ass like a pig and never gaining any weight.,Client,depression,undefined
She was a total Mia. My dad never saw it.,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Client,disgust,undefined
You can say it.,Client,disgust,undefined
I've heard it a thousand times before.,Client,disgust,undefined
You think I have an eating disorder.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why can't anybody understand?,Client,disgust,undefined
This is just the way I'm built.,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't get hungry.,Client,disgust,undefined
I can go a whole day and never get hungry.,Client,disgust,undefined
It doesn't mean I'm anorexic.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I'm an Olympic hopeful, for God's sakes.",Client,disgust,undefined
I know what my body is and isn't capable of.,Client,disgust,undefined
I know my body better at 16,Client,disgust,undefined
than regular people ever will.,Client,disgust,undefined
Never saw her again.,Client,depression,undefined
She starved to death hopefully.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
He never stayed with any of them for very long.,Client,depression,undefined
And when she told him that she thought,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"that you had an eating disorder, did he take her seriously?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
Did he try to get you to eat more?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, He likes me for myself,",Client,neutral,undefined
And he loves how I look.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He said if the whole gymnastics thing doesn't work out,",Client,neutral,undefined
He can get me a job as a model...,Client,neutral,undefined
Like that.,Client,neutral,undefined
So how do you feel about your weight?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I love it.,Client,joy,undefined
I like being light and thin.,Client,joy,undefined
I like feeling I could just slip away through a crack in the door if I had to.,Client,joy,undefined
Can you think of a time when you used your...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"lightness, as you call it, to slip away?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm describing a feeling. Don't be so literal.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay. Fair enough.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Can you think of a time then when you thought,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I wish I could just slip away?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How about right now?,Client,depression,undefined
That party where the boy took you into the...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Into the bedroom. Didn't you want to slip away then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was trashed.,Client,joy,undefined
You don't get it.,Client,neutral,undefined
What don't I get?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The slipping away thing.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's a girl thing,",Client,neutral,undefined
The wanting to be liked.,Client,neutral,undefined
"To be there, but not to be there. It's like...",Client,neutral,undefined
Can we talk about something else?,Client,disgust,undefined
Finish the thought.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"No, I wanna talk about something else.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Okay, What would you like to talk about then?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
How's your daughter?,Client,disgust,undefined
Rosie? She's...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"She's fine, thank you.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Is she still with that fucked-up guy?,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you really want to talk about my daughter,Therapist,neutral,Open question
or are you just trying to make me uncomfortable?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't wanna talk about her if you don't.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why wouldn't I?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You never mention her.,Client,depression,undefined
"After you left last week, I couldn't help thinking,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
about how you didn't tell me that your dad was in Miami.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
We're back to that?,Client,depression,undefined
So he still doesn't know about your attempted suicide?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't wanna talk about this.,Client,disgust,undefined
Is it something you wanna keep a secret from him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's not a fucking secret!,Client,anger,undefined
How can it be a secret if that's all you and my mom,Client,anger,undefined
and everyone else can talk about?,Client,anger,undefined
What are you thinking about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing.,Client,disgust,undefined
I've a test tomorrow I have to study for and I missed,Client,disgust,undefined
"my dentist appointment today, so I have to reschedule that.",Client,disgust,undefined
I think you're running away.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What?,Client,disgust,undefined
"In your mind, you're planning your schedule.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
We get close to something,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"that feels dangerous to you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And what do you do? You retreat.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm not retreating.,Client,anger,undefined
"I'm stressed about the exam, I think I have a cavity,",Client,anger,undefined
and I have a stomachache from that fucking pizza.,Client,anger,undefined
What a mistake that was.,Client,anger,undefined
I have a theory about that pizza.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Surprise, surprise.",Client,depression,undefined
Would you like to hear it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do I have a choice?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yeah. You always have a choice.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
What's your theory?,Client,depression,undefined
I think that you were enjoying that pizza.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Until I said something that reminded you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
of something your father's girlfriend used to say to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I used the word <i>gusto.</i>,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you saying I'm fucked up about food,Client,disgust,undefined
because of something my father's girlfriend said?,Client,disgust,undefined
Are you fucked up about food?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Isn't everybody?,Client,neutral,undefined
What does food mean to you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What do you mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Is it nutrition, is it enjoyment?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's the enemy.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's just what happens to gymnasts.,Client,joy,undefined
Why didn't you tell me your father was in Miami?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why was it a secret?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's not a fucking secret.,Client,disgust,undefined
I just don't think I need to bother him with every boring detail of my life.,Client,disgust,undefined
Your attempted suicide is a boring detail?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's not a suicide attempt. I was just testing. Remember?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Somebody around here had that theory, I think.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Yeah, that rings a bell.",Client,disgust,undefined
He'd put it together and decide that it's all your fault.,Client,disgust,undefined
"He already thinks you're a quack, remember?",Client,disgust,undefined
It's better for you if he doesn't know. He'll never let me come back here.,Client,disgust,undefined
Better for you or for me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Which of us would have to stay away from therapy, do you think?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"If he knew, he'd be devastated.",Client,depression,undefined
He is the most important person to me in this whole world.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't ever wanna hurt him.,Client,depression,undefined
Why can't you just let it go?,Client,disgust,undefined
Forget it.,Client,depression,undefined
This is such a waste of time.,Client,depression,undefined
You tried to kill yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you don't want to tell the most important person in your world?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He has a life!,Client,anger,undefined
Somebody has to.,Client,anger,undefined
We can't all go around like walking corpses.,Client,anger,undefined
It's not his fault that I took those pills!,Client,anger,undefined
"I'm not saying it is his fault, I'm just trying to figure out",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
why you were so ready to leave the planet and not tell him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What's up your ass?,Client,anger,undefined
Are you angry at him for something?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm not angry at him.,Client,anger,undefined
Are you hiding something from me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Get off my back!,Client,anger,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Are we done?,Client,anger,undefined
We have a little time left.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
What?,Client,anger,undefined
You've never wanted to end a session early before.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
In our first session you mentioned those books up there.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I thought it was because you identified with them. You said they were...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
cold and lonely on the top shelf.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And then I looked at them more closely and I realized that,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
one of them has...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
some of your father's photographs in it.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You said that your dad,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
loves the way that you look.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And that...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"if you weren't a gymnast, that you could be a model.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I guess models are the people that he...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"That he chooses to surround himself with,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the people he likes.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They're the people he fucks. I wouldn't say he likes them.,Client,depression,undefined
I know that in our culture thin models...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"are sexualized, but I've always found that really strange,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"because in classical art and literature,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
eating is often used as a metaphor for sex.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They both conjure up,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"desire, hunger,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
cravings inside us.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Where are you going, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Sophie, try to stay here, please.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Try not to disappear.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Eat shit, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Eat shit, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
Why are you doing this?,Client,disgust,undefined
I thought you were trying to help.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why does the book provoke such a strong reaction in you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What you're doing is sick.,Client,anger,undefined
It's fucking sick! It's perverted.,Client,anger,undefined
I'll never forgive you for this.,Client,anger,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I'm making you uncomfortable?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm asking you to think about things that you don't want to talk about.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"If I wanted to talk about my father's book,",Client,anger,undefined
"I would have told you, it was right there.",Client,anger,undefined
What about all that crap about a patient deciding what we talk about?,Client,anger,undefined
"That you take things at my speed,",Client,anger,undefined
that I control the wheels and all that? You're so full of shit.,Client,anger,undefined
But you have been driving what we talk about here.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You may not realize it, but you have.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The very first thing that you wanted to talk about were those books up there.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What are you saying? That you jerk off to my father's photographs?,Client,anger,undefined
That you open up that book and jerk off all over those sluts?,Client,anger,undefined
You keep suggesting somebody is abusing me. You're abusing me!,Client,anger,undefined
"That's what you people love most of all, isn't it? A good mindfuck.",Client,anger,undefined
To take the one good thing in somebody's life,Client,anger,undefined
and somehow fuck it up!,Client,anger,undefined
Just like my father said.,Client,anger,undefined
Shut the fuck up about him!,Client,anger,undefined
How could you?,Client,anger,undefined
How could you? You're just like everybody else!,Client,anger,undefined
"Like who, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Please, don't go.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Why did you do that?,Client,sadness,undefined
You mean why did I take the book down?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Because I had to.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I had to put the book on the table.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And there was really no graceful way of doing it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think this book is connected to your wound.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And opening a wound, Sophie...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is frightening.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's painful.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it's ugly.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You implied that I'd been sexually abused.,Client,sadness,undefined
Is that what you heard?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I never said anything like that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
This book with the...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
with the naked models.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You wanted me to see that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You know what I think?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think you're angry.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think you've got great anger towards your father.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You said earlier on that you wished that,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"you could slip through the cracks when you wanted to,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but you don't do that when you're in trouble. Not really.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Your mind tries to, but your body,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
your body stays here.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You let others do things to you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because you've convinced yourself that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That you're not really there.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That it's not happening to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That it's not hurting you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm sure this week you'll exercise like a fiend.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And not because you're an Olympic hopeful.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But because I know that after this session, you're gonna want",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to regain control.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But I want you to remember something, Sophie.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"When you go up onto that beam,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
that's the place where you detach.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
That's where you go to feel safe.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
All I want you to know is you don't have to go there.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
There are other places where you can feel safe.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"In here, in this room.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
It's one of those places.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Bye,Client,neutral,undefined
"How are you, Amy?",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Good.,Client,neutral,undefined
You seem a little...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
restless.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I wanted to get here early. I just... I rushed a little.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why would you rush to be here early?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, one of us is often late, so...",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Jake's not coming.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Don't worry, we're together. Everything's fine.",Client,neutral,undefined
"We're seemingly in love, and he knows that I'm here",Client,neutral,undefined
and it's fine for him to know everything that we talk about.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I have to tell you, I was offended...",Client,neutral,undefined
"Outside, just now.",Client,neutral,undefined
I know I'm an adult and you have things that I don't need to see or hear,Client,neutral,undefined
but I felt like a scolded child.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It... never mind. It's crazy. It's not you, it's me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know what's gotten into me, but I felt a little embarrassed",Client,neutral,undefined
because I'd already stood up and you suddenly stopped me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Patients you have a different relationship with.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I know Jake and I aren't easy,",Client,neutral,undefined
and I just think you must have...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Easier patients, more interesting patients,",Client,neutral,undefined
"patients that are more fun, that you like more.",Client,neutral,undefined
Is my enjoyment of our sessions important to you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe.,Client,neutral,undefined
And so it would bother you if I didn't enjoy them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe not.,Client,neutral,undefined
Forget it.,Client,neutral,undefined
You said that Jake and you...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Weren't easy as patients.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How would you define yourself as a patient?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Bad.,Client,joy,undefined
Just kidding.,Client,joy,undefined
I wouldn't trade places with anyone. It just...,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you ever thought about changing places with anybody?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Perhaps.,Client,neutral,undefined
Who would you like to trade with?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What kind of a patient would you like to be?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe I want you to be different.,Client,neutral,undefined
Me? Different how?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Harrison Ford.,Client,joy,undefined
"That's a bit of a stretch for me, but...",Therapist,joy,Open question
So how would Dr. Harrison Ford behave,Therapist,joy,Open question
if you were early for a session?,Therapist,joy,Open question
Who says I'd be seeing him for therapy?,Client,neutral,undefined
He certainly wouldn't make me wait outside like a naughty schoolgirl.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you felt that was like some kind of rejection?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No...,Client,neutral,undefined
OK. So...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Why don't you tell me what's been happening,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
since I saw you last week.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Everything's fine, like I told you.",Client,neutral,undefined
You said that you and Jake were seemingly in love.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What does that mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Seemingly in love... I said that, didn't I?",Client,neutral,undefined
Typical. Everything's fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why is that typical?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Today, he's meeting a guy",Client,depression,undefined
that might commission some music from him.,Client,depression,undefined
You make it sound like you don't think that's going to happen.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And he said to me that I should come here on my own,",Client,depression,undefined
"that talking does me good. It's not like Jake to send me here alone, is it?",Client,depression,undefined
"You've turned him into the new and improved Jake,",Client,neutral,undefined
the new sensitive Jake.,Client,neutral,undefined
You could cut the mutual support this week with a knife.,Client,neutral,undefined
You look great. Your makeup looks good.,Client,neutral,undefined
You'll be working late? That's fine. Good luck.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The other day,",Client,joy,undefined
"before a meeting, he actually said to me: Go get 'em!",Client,joy,undefined
isn't that funny?,Client,joy,undefined
Why is it funny?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It is so...,Client,neutral,undefined
sweet.,Client,disgust,undefined
And sweet isn't good?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Sweet's fattening.,Client,depression,undefined
And then two days ago he said to me: Would you like to have sex with me?,Client,neutral,undefined
Would I like to have sex with him? Can you believe it?,Client,joy,undefined
It's like he was offering me a canapé.,Client,depression,undefined
And then he kept wanting to kiss me and touch me,Client,depression,undefined
"and be all loving and affectionate. He kept saying,",Client,depression,undefined
do you like this? Does this feel good? It actually got very tiresome.,Client,depression,undefined
"And at the end, when he was through,",Client,depression,undefined
"I found myself patting him on the back like I was burping a baby,",Client,depression,undefined
"and kept whispering my name, Amy, Amy.",Client,disgust,undefined
It was such a turnoff.,Client,disgust,undefined
And why was that such a turnoff?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was just so...,Client,depression,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"So what, Amy?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is it worse than whispering I'm gonna kill you in your ear?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Much worse.,Client,depression,undefined
"God, all that tenderness.",Client,depression,undefined
Not your cup of tea.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You know what? Sex like that is terrible.,Client,disgust,undefined
What we need is angry sex.,Client,disgust,undefined
"That's what we had, it held us together.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Even when we wanted to kill each other, we had that,",Client,disgust,undefined
maybe because we wanted to kill each other.,Client,disgust,undefined
This touchy-feely sex wasn't the deal.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, the kind of sex we used to have,",Client,disgust,undefined
"I couldn't even tell my girlfriends. They wouldn't have believed me,",Client,disgust,undefined
or else they'd call social services and have Jake arrested.,Client,disgust,undefined
Now it's like he's had a lobotomy or like he's brain-dead.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Only he's not brain-dead, he's just a terrible fuck.",Client,disgust,undefined
It's your fault.,Client,disgust,undefined
It's my fault?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
The man in touch with himself.,Client,depression,undefined
"God, might be better if he knocked me around a bit.",Client,depression,undefined
You really think that'd be better?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe I deserve it.,Client,depression,undefined
"How do you like my necklace, by the way?",Client,disgust,undefined
I think it's...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's very nice.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's a gift.,Client,neutral,undefined
From Jake?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
A Bulgari from Jake?,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's from Ben. Do you remember Ben, my boss?",Client,neutral,undefined
I told Jake that I'd be going back to the office tonight,Client,depression,undefined
because I have a conference call with some clients in Bali.,Client,depression,undefined
"I also told him that Ben was traveling, but the truth is",Client,depression,undefined
Ben is picking me up from here and we're not going back to the office.,Client,depression,undefined
Where are you going?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Wherever the evening takes us.,Client,neutral,undefined
What do you think of that?,Client,depression,undefined
"What, dinner with your boss?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
It won't be dinner.,Client,depression,undefined
"It might include dinner, but there's no stopping the rest of it.",Client,depression,undefined
Why can't it be stopped?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you want me to stop it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It won't do any good. I know it'll happen.,Client,depression,undefined
"Ben and I are inevitable. The minute that the thought entered my head,",Client,disgust,undefined
it was as if somebody had triggered a ticking time-bomb.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Nothing will stop it, no matter how many bomb experts I bring in.",Client,disgust,undefined
"You can't stop it, no one can.",Client,disgust,undefined
"So, who triggered the time bomb?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
The lousy sex.,Client,depression,undefined
"I was in the shower... By the way, it's the first time",Client,depression,undefined
I've been in a hurry to get in the shower after fucking Jake.,Client,depression,undefined
And it dawned on me that no matter what I do...,Client,depression,undefined

"This new tenderness, this new...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Attentiveness that he's shown?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why am I doing this? Why can't I stop?,Client,depression,undefined
You haven't done anything yet.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But he'll be here in a minute.,Client,depression,undefined

"That really captured your imagination, didn't it?",Client,joy,undefined
I think it's something that we should talk about.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I know you said it didn't bother you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but you did say something about children being cruel.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I was fat. Not overweight, fat.",Client,neutral,undefined
My sister was the overweight one.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm kidding. My sister's gorgeous.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's really hard for me to believe that you actually ever were...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
This overweight kid.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's like you've erased that girl.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Right after my father died, I decided to stop eating.",Client,depression,undefined
It's like I woke up 45 pounds thinner.,Client,depression,undefined
How do you wake up 45 pounds thinner?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I just didn't eat.,Client,depression,undefined
And I felt like it was the one thing that I could control in that house.,Client,depression,undefined
Some days I'd just have one cracker all day long,Client,depression,undefined
and I'd feel my stomach get flatter and I'd have this wonderful sense,Client,joy,undefined
"of light-headedness, this wonderful high.",Client,joy,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Doesn't matter.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, go on, finish the thought.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"My father was a lovely man. Sweet, charming. I loved him very much.",Client,neutral,undefined
"My father was a lovely man. Sweet, charming. I loved him very much.",Client,neutral,undefined
And your mother?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
My mother's dead.,Client,joy,undefined
You know the joke about the farmer with the two cows?,Client,joy,undefined
The one cow gives milk and the other one doesn't?,Client,joy,undefined
No,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Never mind. Anyway, my dad died when I was 13.",Client,neutral,undefined
"My mother's rather like Cinderella's stepmother,",Client,neutral,undefined
and my sister is like the evil stepsister.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Once, when I was 13...",Client,neutral,undefined
"My parents came back from Milan with two identical dresses,",Client,neutral,undefined
very very beautiful ones.,Client,neutral,undefined
"A red one for Maria, my sister,",Client,neutral,undefined
and a blue one for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Mine, of course, didn't fit me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"So, my mother told her to switch with me",Client,neutral,undefined
because she was older and hers was slightly bigger.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She, of course, didn't want to, so she started screaming",Client,neutral,undefined
"and said she wanted the red dress, it's not her fault that I'm so fat.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And finally, she threw the dress at me and said: Then take it, fatso.",Client,neutral,undefined
So I started crying.,Client,joy,undefined
And my mother said: What are you crying for now?,Client,neutral,undefined
You should be glad your sister's dress fits you,Client,neutral,undefined
and that she agreed to trade dresses. You should thank her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Later, I heard my parents arguing and my dad said to my mom:",Client,neutral,undefined
Why didn't you just get them the same color dress?,Client,neutral,undefined
"And my mother started whispering, she said: I can't buy her red, she...",Client,neutral,undefined
I couldn't hear her properly then. She seemed like she said: She looks...,Client,depression,undefined
"like a watermelon in it., or: She'd look like a fire truck in it.,",Client,depression,undefined
"or: She'd look like a beach ball., or...",Client,depression,undefined
I couldn't hear what she said.,Client,depression,undefined
So did you ever talk to your dad,Therapist,neutral,Open question
about what you might have heard?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I never got a chance.",Client,depression,undefined
So could you have talked to your mom about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She'd say that I was making things up. That's what she said,Client,neutral,undefined
to most of my complaints. She used to call me the fabricator.,Client,neutral,undefined
I had a very vivid imagination. I used to make things up.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Once, I told her that I saw my sister kissing",Client,joy,undefined
the gardener behind the house.,Client,joy,undefined
She went ballistic. She nearly had a coronary.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, once, Maria had a blind date,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and before he got there, she said: Let's play a trick on him.",Client,neutral,undefined
And she told me to open the door and pretend that I was her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And she'd watch from the room next door,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and if she didn't like him, she wouldn't come out",Client,neutral,undefined
and I could pretend that I was sick and cancel the date.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So when I opened the door, he was really cute.",Client,neutral,undefined
And I thought she'd be interested in him.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So I kept talking to him,",Client,neutral,undefined
and pretending to be her and chatting away.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She finally came out from the other room and said: Hi, I'm Maria.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And he was completely confused, and I was...",Client,depression,undefined
"utterly humiliated. I went so red. Actually,",Client,depression,undefined
"I still get embarrassed when I think about it today, and...",Client,depression,undefined
And she told him I was just checking out her dates for her,Client,depression,undefined
and that at it was all just a joke.,Client,depression,undefined
"The thing is, I didn't get the joke. I mean, not till years later.",Client,depression,undefined
"I didn't realize till then,",Client,depression,undefined
that all she really wanted was to see the look of relief on his face,Client,depression,undefined
"when he realized that she was his date, not me, the fatso.",Client,depression,undefined
"Hilarious, right?",Client,joy,undefined
"Don't worry, I got back at her years later.",Client,depression,undefined
I met him at college and I fucked his brains out.,Client,depression,undefined
I told her that he didn't remember her and I'd had to remind him.,Client,depression,undefined
"And she said: Whatever, I dumped him after two dates anyway.",Client,depression,undefined
And I said: He told me he dumped you because you smelled like tuna.,Client,depression,undefined
And is that true?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"So really, you settled that account in bed.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I did indeed.,Client,depression,undefined
"And now you're settling another account in bed, with Jake this time.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"What, because he's become too sensitive for you?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
So let me make sure I have this right.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Your father died when you were 13.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You must have been pretty devastated.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was.,Client,depression,undefined
He was a lovely man. He was affectionate and great.,Client,depression,undefined
Physically affectionate?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, He'd come into our room at night, when we were sleeping and...",Client,neutral,undefined
kiss us on the eyes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And then I'd half wake up, I'd smell his aftershave",Client,neutral,undefined
and know that he was there.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then he'd whisper in my ear that he loved me and...,Client,neutral,undefined
He'd hold my face in his hands.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He had these huge hands, like a construction worker.",Client,neutral,undefined
And he was just...,Client,neutral,undefined
So...,Client,neutral,undefined
Tender and lovely.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And yet, when Jake is tender",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and he expresses his love through tenderness, it makes you angry.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You said it was disgusting.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think that might be because it scares you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You've learned you can't trust people who express themselves,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"tenderly, that they seem weak?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That they're going to abandon you, die and leave you behind?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"And so in order to avoid that, you provoke Jake. You make him angry.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You create these situations that bring out the worst in him,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and he treats you badly.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Ben'll be here any minute. What should I do?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you really want me to give you permission to have sex with your boss?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Once. Just once. Just tell me it's not that bad.,Client,depression,undefined
I think it might be that bad.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But you'll explain him if he finds out. Can you make sense of it for him?,Client,depression,undefined
And what exactly do you want me to tell him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That I'm fucked up!,Client,disgust,undefined
That I can't help myself. That it's bigger than me.,Client,disgust,undefined
Tell him that I'm fucked up!,Client,disgust,undefined
"So even if he forgives you,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
do you think that you can forgive yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I always forgive myself.,Client,depression,undefined
That's my problem. I... I just close my eyes,Client,depression,undefined
before I go to sleep at night and I ask God for forgiveness,Client,depression,undefined
and I forgive myself for everything.,Client,depression,undefined
Even the unforgivable things.,Client,depression,undefined
I never get punished.,Client,depression,undefined
You think that sex with Reeves will go unpunished?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Who's gonna punish me?,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe you've already started to punish yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you really think that sleeping with Reeves is gonna bring back,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"the good old reliable angry, controlling Jake?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
The one who fights you and threatens you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And now that he's expressing his love through tenderness,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
do you feel that you deserve his love?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's not love!,Client,disgust,undefined
It's neediness. It's weakness. It's unbearable.,Client,disgust,undefined
"So it's only love if he chases you, stalks you,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"tapes you, is jealous of you, is that it?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I think you need to look at this a little more carefully, Amy.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
It's like it's happened already.,Client,depression,undefined
But it hasn't.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You still have a choice.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Nothing happens without you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I have to go to the bathroom.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sorry the gravy train is ending here, doc.",Client,neutral,undefined
That's okay. So why are you leaving?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I got you curious, huh?",Client,joy,undefined
Remember I told you my squadron commander called me?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, last week they finally brought me in.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Now I thought they wanted to ease me back in, but no.",Client,neutral,undefined
"They need me to train the next wave of pilots for their deployment,",Client,neutral,undefined
Get them ready to fly asap.,Client,neutral,undefined
Always playing catch-up in this war.,Client,neutral,undefined
So what did you say to them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I said, Fuck you!",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm 39 years old, in the prime of my life",Client,neutral,undefined
and one of the most decorated fighter pilots in the Navy.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, you're not gonna put me out to pasture,",Client,neutral,undefined
not in the middle of a war. Get yourself another boy.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's what you said to them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, not really, but I thought it.",Client,joy,undefined
"Actually what I said was,",Client,joy,undefined
"Yes, sir. However I can be of service to you, sir. And...",Client,joy,undefined
I reported for duty the next day. You think I'm crazy?,Client,joy,undefined
I can only get away with that bullshit with you.,Client,joy,undefined
"Well, at least we know why you come here.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So what's it like being back at base?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"When they look in my eyes, they know i've been places",Client,neutral,undefined
they couldn't conjure up in their worst nightmares.,Client,neutral,undefined
Makes them think twice before fucking with me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So, training young pilots...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is that something you can see yourself doing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know, maybe in another context.",Client,neutral,undefined
But this is set up to fail.,Client,neutral,undefined
There's no way these kids are gonna be ready for combat missions in a month.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, it's crazy.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm taking them through tactical situations.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Some of them are doing better than others,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but when you're up in the air, it's read and react.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Read, react, like a machine. No thinking. It's like split-second",Client,neutral,undefined
"decisions that can cost thousands of lives, including their own.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Most of these kids, they look at me on the simulators and they're like, whoa!",Client,joy,undefined
"Well, they're blown away.",Client,neutral,undefined
That must feel really great.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I overheard a couple of these kids talking shit about me,",Client,neutral,undefined
Saying that I might be good on the simulators,Client,neutral,undefined
but they'd kick my ass on the obstacle course.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Called me old man, all that bullshit. Well, hey...",Client,neutral,undefined
I called their bluff. Check this out: now the drill,Client,joy,undefined
is called the gauntlet. It's a five-mile run through dense woods,Client,joy,undefined
"and sand traps, and rope-and-barrier hurdles, balance beams",Client,joy,undefined
"and a maze. Now after all that,",Client,joy,undefined
there's the helo-dunker.,Client,joy,undefined
Nothe helo-Dunker is like this giant...,Client,joy,undefined
It looks like a beer can.,Client,joy,undefined
It's basically a crash simulator.,Client,joy,undefined
"We hit the water hard, upside down, strapped in tight.",Client,joy,undefined
And we have to get out,Client,joy,undefined
"with almost no oxygen. We're in full gear: helmet, spacesuit,",Client,joy,undefined
"G-suit, gloves, the whole nine yards.",Client,joy,undefined
Now there are four immersions.,Client,joy,undefined
"The last two, the water's dark.",Client,joy,undefined
It's like a night landing.,Client,neutral,undefined
"A lot of these kids, they get disoriented",Client,neutral,undefined
and start flipping the fuck out.,Client,neutral,undefined
So we have to rescue them.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's tough.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It separates the men from the boys, let me tell you.",Client,joy,undefined
"So, doc...",Client,joy,undefined
how do you think I did?,Client,joy,undefined
"Do I really have to guess, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Touche.,Client,joy,undefined
I never panic.,Client,joy,undefined
"I'm at home down there in the dark,",Client,joy,undefined
swimming for my life.,Client,joy,undefined
"And not only did I beat all their asses,",Client,joy,undefined
I came within two seconds of a base record.,Client,joy,undefined
"Not bad for a broken-down old pilot, huh?",Client,joy,undefined
"Come on, Paul.",Client,joy,undefined
"Okay, so my squadron commander calls me back up to his office.",Client,neutral,undefined
This time all the brass were there,Client,neutral,undefined
and they want to know if i'm interested in going back to active duty.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If I am, I have to go through a modified basic training",Client,neutral,undefined
"at Pensacola, a battery of tests... Physical, psychological...",Client,neutral,undefined
Just to make sure I've recovered.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So I said,",Client,joy,undefined
"bring it on, baby! I'm ready for anything!",Client,joy,undefined
Are you surprised?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, a little, I guess.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I shouldn't be, but I suppose it was always a possibility.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"But you think it's too fast, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think it's too fast?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Doc, you have no idea",Client,joy,undefined
how good it feels to be useful again.,Client,joy,undefined
"To tell you the truth, I think that's been the real problem.",Client,neutral,undefined
I've been sitting around feeling sorry for myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm a doer, not a talker,",Client,neutral,undefined
so all of this... That's over.,Client,neutral,undefined
Those days are over. So here's what I need from you:,Client,joy,undefined
You're gonna get a call from one of your compatriots.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's a Navy doctor named Connell. He's gonna be checking up on me.,Client,neutral,undefined
You told the Navy you were seeing me? I thought that was professional suicide.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, they caught wind that I had left the house.",Client,neutral,undefined
They wanted to know if it had anything to do wit the bombing and the aftermath.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I told them i'd been doing some counseling with you...,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, my marriage... And that I was fit as a fiddle.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you feel fit as a fiddle?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Paul, don't fuck with me on this.",Client,neutral,undefined
You're talking about my career now.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Just tell him all good things. Plus, the Navy needs me.",Client,neutral,undefined
You think they can afford to have someone like me just pissing around?,Client,neutral,undefined
Just tell him i'm ready.,Client,neutral,undefined
Let's just talk about whether you are ready or not.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Hey, cut the crap! I need this.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Hey, cut the crap! I need this.",Client,disgust,undefined
"You're putting me in a very difficult position, Alex.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
We talked about a lot more than michaela.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"You don't expect me to lie, do you?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Okay, physically i'm fine.",Client,neutral,undefined
I had the heart attack almost four months ago.,Client,neutral,undefined
All the cardiologists say that...,Client,neutral,undefined
They're amazed by my recovery. I can handle it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But what about emotionally, Alex?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can you imagine yourself back in an airplane,Therapist,neutral,Open question
flying a mission after what happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You're talking about the madrasa thing?,Client,depression,undefined
The madrasa thing is the crisis that brought you here in the first place.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you sure that you're ready,Therapist,neutral,Open question
to put yourself in that kind of situation again?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, listen. Terrorists hide among civilians.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's a common tactic. It's their fault,Client,neutral,undefined
"if there's collateral damage, not ours.",Client,neutral,undefined
They're the ones putting their women and children at risk.,Client,neutral,undefined
Let's put aside the question of who's at fault or who isn't.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Could you live with yourself,Therapist,neutral,Open question
if you were responsible for more civilian casualties?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's bullshit.,Client,depression,undefined
"Alex, you gave yourself a heart attack a few months ago.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Can you honestly tell me that you're not worried,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
that you're not scared that your guilt will lead to...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Guilt is not an issue for a pilot in a time of war.,Client,joy,undefined
We're not trained to think that way.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not asking what you think.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm asking you to tell me what you feel.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And i'm telling you it doesn't matter.,Client,neutral,undefined
Let me just see who this is. Sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
It went fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, they did ask me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I can't talk about that right now. Can I call you back?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Michaela, let me go, all right? I'm with somebody right now.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I will.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, bye.",Client,neutral,undefined
Sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
She wanted to know how the meeting with the brass went.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, she's totally obsessed with me flying again. You know that.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you think she's so anxious for you to fly again?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, my little sabbatical",Client,neutral,undefined
upset her sense of order.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If it was a couple of weeks, it would be all right.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I was taking a break, whatever.",Client,neutral,undefined
I told you we were having dinner to discuss me coming back home.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yeah, well, the heat is on.",Client,depression,undefined
I don't think I can fight it any longer.,Client,depression,undefined
Plus it's what everybody wants.,Client,depression,undefined
Everyone?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Everybody... My father included.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, he and michaela, they're united in everything.",Client,depression,undefined
Why is you father so anxious for you to fly again?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, there's nothing deep behind it, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
He thinks I need to get back to my job. It's what a man does.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he's right.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can you tell me how you got to that conclusion?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are you sure you have time for that?,Client,joy,undefined
Cause I...,Client,joy,undefined
We've got plenty of time. I think this is something important,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
we need to talk about especially if you are trying to push me for an assessment.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
It's hot as hell in here.,Client,neutral,undefined
"We had a party for my son,",Client,depression,undefined
A birthday party...,Client,depression,undefined
And everything became clear.,Client,depression,undefined
I told you my son roy is a special kid.,Client,depression,undefined
Have I told you that?,Client,depression,undefined
He doesn't seem to need friends.,Client,depression,undefined
"So, when we asked him what kind of party he wanted, he said only family.",Client,depression,undefined
I supported that.,Client,depression,undefined
I didn't want to force him to be anything he isn't.,Client,depression,undefined
"So all the uncles and aunts came and the cousins,",Client,depression,undefined
and everybody was in a good mood.,Client,depression,undefined
"My dad, he got there early.",Client,depression,undefined
He's establishing and setting up everything,Client,depression,undefined
"and acting like he owns the place,",Client,depression,undefined
ordering my wife around.,Client,depression,undefined
I could tell he had been there a lot since I left.,Client,depression,undefined
"And the bitch he married, she was there too,",Client,disgust,undefined
in the kitchen cooking as if my mother never existed.,Client,disgust,undefined
"It made me feel like shit,",Client,disgust,undefined
Like a...,Client,disgust,undefined
A stranger in my own home.,Client,disgust,undefined
My father sees me and he gives me one of those cold smiles.,Client,depression,undefined
"Alex, nice of you to make it.",Client,depression,undefined
I could tell he had,Client,depression,undefined
a wild hair up his ass about something.,Client,depression,undefined
But I didn't ask.,Client,depression,undefined
"'Cause when he wants to share, he shares.",Client,depression,undefined
"And then he's all over me,",Client,depression,undefined
And i'm in no rush to get there.,Client,depression,undefined
"But he is great with roy, though. They connect.",Client,depression,undefined
Somehow it's easy for them.,Client,depression,undefined
Did you feel like you weren't connecting with roy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
There were a lot of people there. We didn't have much time alone.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you seen a lot of him since you left home?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Once, twice. I don't know what you consider a lot.",Client,neutral,undefined
Did he ever ask why you weren't living at home anymore?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah. I told him his dad,Client,depression,undefined
was on a special mission.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, i'm gone half the time. He's used to it.",Client,depression,undefined
"To tell you the truth, i think it's been a relief for him.",Client,depression,undefined
Why would it be a relief for his dad to be away?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Well...,Client,joy,undefined
Well... He was loose as hell at the party.,Client,joy,undefined
"He's running around, he's playing with his cousins,",Client,joy,undefined
he's talking to everybody.,Client,joy,undefined
You should have seen him. He was a different person.,Client,joy,undefined
"He was open, he was outgoing.",Client,joy,undefined
It's like he bloomed in my absence.,Client,joy,undefined
"Well, not bloomed.",Client,joy,undefined
"Jeez, he's not a fucking flower. It's like he spread his wings.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, that's what it was like.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Maybe he was happy because you were there,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe because he was just glad to see you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"It's interesting when you talk about flying, Alex,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because you make no bones whatsoever about the fact.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"that the Navy really needs you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that they can't do it without you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Yet when it comes to talking about your son...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Paul, Paul, slow the fuck down.",Client,joy,undefined
The boy was having a great day before I ever got there.,Client,joy,undefined
Is it possible that you're projecting,Therapist,neutral,Open question
your own feelings about your father onto your son?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How do you mean?,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, that you might be doing better yourself||",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"spreading your wings too if he wasn't there,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
If he wasn't...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"in your way, so to speak.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, doc, my being there",Client,neutral,undefined
didn't make the kid happy that day.,Client,neutral,undefined
Just the opposite in fact.,Client,depression,undefined
How? What happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I told you roy was obsessed with chess, right?",Client,joy,undefined
I got him this magnificent set.,Client,joy,undefined
"It was all ivory, imported from Nairobi,",Client,joy,undefined
Just a real work of art.,Client,joy,undefined
"And he just looked at the pieces, mesmerized.",Client,joy,undefined
"But the board, that was only half of the gift. The other half...",Client,joy,undefined
was that I had been working on my own chess game,Client,joy,undefined
And I was gonna play my boy.,Client,joy,undefined
So we sat down at the chessboard. Everybody's watching.,Client,joy,undefined
I thought i'd open with something simple...,Client,joy,undefined
"The king's indian, which is where you establish your pawns",Client,joy,undefined
in the center of the board.,Client,joy,undefined
"Then he moved, and I countered.",Client,joy,undefined
And he moved again. I countered again.,Client,depression,undefined
And we're moving along at this real nice clip,Client,joy,undefined
and I think I'm holding my own.,Client,joy,undefined
And then...,Client,neutral,undefined
I'll never forget it. He looked up suddenly,Client,neutral,undefined
and it was like a shadow fell over his face.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And he stood up from the table and he said,",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not feeling well. I don't want to play.,Client,neutral,undefined
He goes up to his bedroom.,Client,neutral,undefined
I follow him up the stairs. I knock on the door.,Client,neutral,undefined
He doesn't answer. I crack the door open and I see him.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's sitting at his desk. He's got his back to me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know if he heard me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was about to say something, but I didn't.",Client,neutral,undefined
I just stood there and I stared at the back of his head.,Client,neutral,undefined
Something about him... I don't know what it was...,Client,depression,undefined
It broke my heart.,Client,depression,undefined
"Then I heard these footsteps coming up behind me, I turn around",Client,depression,undefined
"and it's my father. And he says, you know why he quit, don't you?",Client,depression,undefined
I shook my head.,Client,depression,undefined
"And he gives me that look, that look that sees right through you.",Client,depression,undefined
"He says, He knew in three moves, Alex,",Client,depression,undefined
You were gonna lose.,Client,depression,undefined
He didn't want to beat his father in front of the whole family.,Client,depression,undefined
He felt sorry for you.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think he was right?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, I know he was right. That's my son to a tee.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Then my father, he pulls me into a room and he just ripped into me.",Client,disgust,undefined
"He says, You are pathetic.",Client,disgust,undefined
One thing goes wrong in your little cushy life,Client,disgust,undefined
and you turn soft as butter.,Client,disgust,undefined
He didn't understand why I wasn't eager to fly again,Client,disgust,undefined
or why I was away from home doing god knows what,Client,disgust,undefined
With god knows who like a fucking teenager.,Client,disgust,undefined
"He says, You disappoint me, boy.",Client,disgust,undefined
I raised you to be stronger than that. I raised you to be a man.,Client,disgust,undefined
And he wanted to know who put all these ideas in my head.,Client,disgust,undefined
Who turned me into a... What did he...,Client,disgust,undefined
"Who turned me into a selfish, whining little bitch.",Client,disgust,undefined
Was it the fags I was hanging around with?,Client,disgust,undefined
Or was it... And this one he really seized on... Was it the shrink?,Client,disgust,undefined
How would he know you were seeing a shrink?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Michaela told him.,Client,depression,undefined
You told her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, I had to.",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know i've been paying you cash,",Client,neutral,undefined
cause I was trying to avoid a paper trail.,Client,neutral,undefined
But that means i've been withdrawing from atms all the time.,Client,neutral,undefined
Michaela looks at the bank statements,Client,neutral,undefined
"and she saw there wasn't money there,",Client,neutral,undefined
she wanted to know where it was going.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, look, I told her I've been consulting with someone",Client,neutral,undefined
"about my thoughts... And that was the word, thoughts...",Client,neutral,undefined
My thoughts about me and her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And did you get into that,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
your thoughts about the two of you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, she shut down.",Client,neutral,undefined
"So anyway, listen. My father...",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, my father... He gives me this whole earful.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He goes downstairs, and, man...",Client,neutral,undefined
I felt like I had been hit by a freight train.,Client,depression,undefined
I locked myself in the bathroom and I sat there,Client,depression,undefined
so I could just catch my breath.,Client,depression,undefined
"And when I finally got my shit together I went back downstairs, and...",Client,depression,undefined
And everybody was around the chessboard again,Client,depression,undefined
"watching another match, including Michaela.",Client,depression,undefined
And...,Client,depression,undefined
You know what it was? It was my father,Client,depression,undefined
"and my son and they are locked in this epic battle,",Client,depression,undefined
Matching each other move for move.,Client,depression,undefined
Totally out of my league.,Client,depression,undefined
And everyone's oohing and ahhing,Client,depression,undefined
Aand they didn't even notice that I was there.,Client,depression,undefined
What was it about Roy that broke your heart,Therapist,neutral,Open question
when you were watching him in his room?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He seemed so...,Client,depression,undefined
"Vulnerable, somehow.",Client,depression,undefined
Vulnerable to what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know, really.",Client,depression,undefined
Everything...,Client,depression,undefined
"Forces, expectations,",Client,depression,undefined
"Stuff coming at him that he can't control,",Client,depression,undefined
I can't control.,Client,depression,undefined
So I slipped out of the house,Client,depression,undefined
without anyone knowing.,Client,depression,undefined
It was for the better.,Client,depression,undefined
For whom?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
For my boy.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you really think that your son,Therapist,neutral,Open question
is better off without his father on his birthday?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, I do.",Client,neutral,undefined
"After that I got in my car and I drove,",Client,depression,undefined
"And drove and drove, fast.",Client,depression,undefined
And when I finally ran out of gas it was after dark.,Client,depression,undefined
I wound up at this bar,Client,depression,undefined
that Sean and Daniel had taken me to.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I started to drink hard,",Client,depression,undefined
looking at all the faggots prancing around.,Client,depression,undefined
I felt like knocking somebody's teeth down their fucking throat.,Client,disgust,undefined
But nobody came near me. They didn't even look at me.,Client,depression,undefined
It was kind of like they knew like I had this invisible force field around me.,Client,depression,undefined
You said before that,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"when you started telling me about the party,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that everything became clear that day.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What was it that became clear?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That I needed to go.,Client,disgust,undefined
I needed to get back to the Navy...,Client,disgust,undefined
"Discipline, order, Yes, sir, no, sir.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Knowing when to go to sleep, when to wake up,",Client,disgust,undefined
"what to wear, what to eat, what to do.",Client,disgust,undefined
To get out of my own head.,Client,disgust,undefined
"This is not for everyone, you know, this self-Examination.",Client,disgust,undefined
Some of us...,Client,disgust,undefined
"we just need to live our lives, man.",Client,disgust,undefined
Why do you think you went to that particular bar?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wanted anyone to so much as breathe,Client,disgust,undefined
"so I could beat the living hell out of them, that's why.",Client,disgust,undefined
But nobody did.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
No.,Client,joy,undefined
"Could it be, Alex, that you were there for exactly the opposite reason?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Cause no one would question you,Therapist,neutral,Open question
or ask you to be anything other than yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You see, these issues with your father, with your own identity,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"with what you really want for yourself,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"these things, they have to be looked at.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Don't you think it would be better to deal with them here on the ground,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"than have them follow you 20,000 feet into the air?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Wait, are you actually expressing an opinion here?",Client,joy,undefined
Are you telling me not to fly?,Client,neutral,undefined
I can't answer that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It makes me feel like you're asking me,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
to share responsibility for another major decision in your life.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You know, go back to baghdad, leave michaela.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think we're way past that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I'm not asking you to decide, Paul. I can decide.",Client,neutral,undefined
I have decided.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, i'm asking you, man to man...",Client,neutral,undefined
"Tell me, what would you do",Client,neutral,undefined
if you were me?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Alex, if I was you,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I would stay in therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"I would continue to deal with the complex,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"difficult issues that we've been talking about,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
not sweep them under the carpet,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
like you've been doing in your life.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I can tell you one thing:,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
They will creep up on you again.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
But you won't tell me not to fly.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, you're wrong.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't make mistakes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When i'm up in the sky, that's when i'm in control.",Client,neutral,undefined
You don't get it yet.,Client,joy,undefined
I am the best.,Client,joy,undefined
"Now, Paul, listen to me.",Client,depression,undefined
Don't fuck me up with this Navy shrink. Please.,Client,depression,undefined
Don't take my world away from me.,Client,depression,undefined
Well...,Client,neutral,undefined
I think we're done.,Client,neutral,undefined

In your chair.,Client,joy,undefined
"Hold up, Paul. I just got to finish this.",Client,neutral,undefined
Take your time.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills

"It's my dad, he's in Boston. I might go visit him next week.",Client,joy,undefined
"Oh my god, the most amazing thing happened last night,",Client,joy,undefined
"You wouldn't believe me, but I don't care.",Client,joy,undefined
Why wouldn't believe you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because you think me and my dad being connected is bullshit.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I never said it was bullshit, I said I might be surprised...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Free your mind, Paul, the rest will follow.",Client,joy,undefined
"Oh my god, that was incredible.",Client,neutral,undefined
I had this dream that my father was in danger.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I woke up feeling a little freaked, so I called him.",Client,neutral,undefined
He's staying in a hotel with his girlfriend.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Turns out, last night...",Client,neutral,undefined
Someone broke into his room and stole his favorite camera.,Client,neutral,undefined
em...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"So, I guess you must be feeling pretty silly now, huh?",Client,joy,undefined
Because you have all this doubts about my father and I telepathy.,Client,joy,undefined

"Last week, you were insinuating...",Client,joy,undefined

"It's been prove once and for all, you can't take that away.",Client,joy,undefined
You said that you might go to Boston.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Don't you have the olympic trials coming up?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Those are after I get back.,Client,neutral,undefined
Those are after I get back.,Client,neutral,undefined
So it's okay,Therapist,neutral,Open question

"Oh I'm sorry, Cy, I was looking for my shrink.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, it's not a big deal.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's just more important to me to spend quality time with him.,Client,joy,undefined
It's been too long.,Client,joy,undefined
Maybe he can come here.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
That way you can see him and you can still continue to train.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
What do you care?,Client,joy,undefined
Did you bet on me to win a medal or something?,Client,joy,undefined

Nudity?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Nude models.,Client,neutral,undefined
The female form.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's like drawing class 101, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
An artist must work from the purest inspiration.,Client,neutral,undefined
"His studio was at home,",Client,neutral,undefined
so there were a lot of models walking around naked.,Client,neutral,undefined
It wasn't a big deal. We were cool.,Client,neutral,undefined

I remember the sound of the latch sliding.,Client,depression,undefined
How old were you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. Seven and a half?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why are you being so dramatic? It was no big deal.,Client,neutral,undefined
My father is an artist.,Client,neutral,undefined
They don't live like other people do.,Client,neutral,undefined
They have to be in touch with...,Client,neutral,undefined

Good. Now we can finally stop talking about that.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why didn't you ever tell your mother what you saw?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Don't be an idiot.,Client,neutral,undefined
So this secret has been there between you and she all these years?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
So what? I barely speak to the woman anyway.,Client,depression,undefined
You don't think there's any connection between those two things?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't speak to her because she's pathetic.,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't speak to her because she's pathetic.,Client,disgust,undefined
She's a moron.,Client,disgust,undefined
She couldn't see what was right in front of her face.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Sometimes I think she's still waiting for him,",Client,depression,undefined
like Santa Claus or something.,Client,depression,undefined
"She would never admit it, but it's so obvious, it's pathetic.",Client,depression,undefined
"But if you told her, she might not be waiting for him any longer.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
It's not my job to make her face reality!,Client,anger,undefined
I'm the child. She's supposed to be smarter than me.,Client,anger,undefined
"You know, she sits there, day after day,",Client,anger,undefined
"waiting for him to come to his senses. I want to scream at her,",Client,anger,undefined
He doesn't give a fuck about you!,Client,anger,undefined
You're stupid. You're useless.,Client,anger,undefined
Just get the fuck up of your clueless ass and get a life!,Client,anger,undefined
Why didn't you tell her about his affairs?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's not my fucking job!,Client,anger,undefined
Maybe you didn't tell her because you were afraid.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Maybe you were afraid they'd separate and it would be your fault,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
just like you thought that you'd ruined Cy and Darlene's marriage?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why didn't you tell your mother after they divorced?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What was I supposed to do? Rub her face in it?,Client,disgust,undefined
You're angry she couldn't see that?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Yes! Fuck yes!,Client,anger,undefined
"Sophie, you know in all the weeks that we've been in therapy,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
you've never once allowed yourself to be angry at your father.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
It's never even been a possibility for you.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Why do you think that is?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"See, I think that your father made you his accomplice.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He burdened you with this secret,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"way too heavy for any child to carry,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and he drove this wedge between you and your mother with this secret.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you're afraid to get angry at him,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"because if you did, you'd lose him for good.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you never told your mother because part of you still hopes,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that they're gonna get back together again.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I know that's never going to happen.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not an idiot.,Client,depression,undefined
Wouldn't have to be to believe that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I know plenty of grownups,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"whose parents have separated 20, 30 years,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
who have even died... They still hope in their heart of hearts,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that their mother and father still share a bed in heaven.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
He wouldn't be a good husband if he came back.,Client,depression,undefined
He'd just leave her again.,Client,depression,undefined
And you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What?,Client,depression,undefined
"He left you too, didn't he?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,depression,undefined
He just moved out. He's still my dad.,Client,depression,undefined
"Of course he's still your dad,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"but he did literally leave you, didn't he?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"He moved away. He's not around,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
he doesn't even know whether you're dead or alive.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He was working.,Client,anger,undefined
Why can't you let yourself be angry at him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why should I be angry at him?,Client,anger,undefined
She's the one who...,Client,anger,undefined
Who pisses me off.,Client,anger,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because she's pathetic,Client,anger,undefined
and annoying and...,Client,anger,undefined
And she's always around.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I can understand why you might be angry at her too, though.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Cause you feel she didn't protect you from what was going on at home.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But she's also a rock.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
She's incredibly patient. She's persistent.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
She's not going anywhere.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
She's really something when you think about it.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Isn't she?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
There's something I haven't told you.,Client,depression,undefined
What's that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm not really that interested in gymnastics anymore.,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Used to be everything to me,",Client,neutral,undefined
and now it's not.,Client,neutral,undefined
And why do you think that is?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, you tell me, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Okay, I think that when you were growing up, there weren't enough boundaries at home.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Boundaries to protect a child from... What we you, six, seven?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
From...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
things that could impact your...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Your view of sex,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"your body,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
your attitudes toward men.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was also an environment,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
where you were expected to be complicit in the lies of grownups.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I think you wanted to escape, so sports became the perfect outlet for you.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"A place with rules and order, where discipline protected you",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and guided you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Gymnastics was always a place that you were able to run away to,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to be in control.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you don't need to run away to that world anymore.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Shit.,Client,depression,undefined
Shit.,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"i'll never make the olympic team now,",Client,depression,undefined
not with that attitude.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, I don't think that's necessarily true.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm gonna suck at it.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you ever failed before?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Never, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"... the times, they are a-changin'.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's from a Bob Dylan song.,Client,neutral,undefined
My gift to you.,Client,joy,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You're welcome.,Client,joy,undefined
He's an old geezer...,Client,joy,undefined
Like you.,Client,joy,undefined
Thanks.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Hello, excuse me.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm sorry. I didn't know which one of these doors was the right one.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's okay. It's a terrible day.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Didn't want to knock on your residence.,Client,neutral,undefined
No problem. This door is usually for people who come in.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
That's usually the exit door.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
But it doesn't... It doesn't really matter.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You have an entry door and an exit door?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's for people's privacy. Some people don't like to...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
They don't like to run into each other.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Are they ashamed?,Client,neutral,undefined
No. It's just... It's protocol really.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Would you like some coffee?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I'm a tea man.",Client,neutral,undefined
"But no, nothing, thank you.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Please, sit down.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I got a lot of questions.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sure you have. And I hope that I can answer some of them.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
One thing I do have to stress from the outset,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
is that anything that is said,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
between myself and a patient in this room...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
is private.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Even then the patient has died.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, even then.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"I am sure we have something to talk about,",Client,neutral,undefined
Something to help me understand what happened to my son.,Client,neutral,undefined
You weren't very forthcoming about who you were,Client,neutral,undefined
when we met at the services.,Client,neutral,undefined
"A friend, you said?",Client,neutral,undefined
That's hardly the case.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I didn't want to betray Alex's confidence.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Daniel didn't hesitate in explaining,Client,neutral,undefined
exactly what your relationship to Alex was.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's very direct... Daniel.,Client,neutral,undefined
I like that about him.,Client,neutral,undefined
Were you surprised to hear that Alex was in therapy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That he didn't tell me surprised me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, what's the big deal?",Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you think he didn't?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"We'll never know the answer to that, will we?",Client,neutral,undefined
Or I won't.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe that's something you discussed here.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, it always puzzled me,",Client,disgust,undefined
"the whole process here, you know?",Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, that... That a person is in therapy at all",Client,disgust,undefined
often is never discussed...,Client,disgust,undefined
"Who the doctor is,",Client,disgust,undefined
"what he's there for, how much it cost.",Client,disgust,undefined
Funny thing is that it's secrecy,Client,disgust,undefined
"or misunderstandings, things never spoken that...",Client,disgust,undefined
usually land people in therapy in the first place.,Client,disgust,undefined
Isn't at ironic?,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't think it's about secrecy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think it's about creating an environment,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
where people can come and feel safe,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
to talk about anything.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Safer than with their loved ones?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sometimes it's easier to talk to somebody,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
who's totally uninvolved in your life...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Somebody objective. Somebody who has no stake in it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You mean like a prostitute, hmm?",Client,disgust,undefined
Someone who's paid for their intimacy and their discretion.,Client,disgust,undefined
A man should have someone to talk to,Client,disgust,undefined
"who cares about him,",Client,disgust,undefined
Not someone who charges by the hour.,Client,disgust,undefined
I really did care for Alex.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"And if I hadn't,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'd actually be a pretty poor therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Do you think Alex spoke about things in this room that he never...,Client,neutral,undefined
spoke to anyone else about?,Client,neutral,undefined
That is usually the case with patients.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
So you probably know as much about him as anyone did.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you feel that you knew your son well?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I knew Alex when he was...,Client,neutral,undefined
a little boy.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what was he like then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, he was...",Client,neutral,undefined
quiet.,Client,neutral,undefined
Introspective.,Client,neutral,undefined
Daydreamer.,Client,neutral,undefined
Inventor.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did he ever mention that to you?,Client,neutral,undefined
"He never did, no.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
He invented this thing for his mother...,Client,joy,undefined
A pan that made flipping an omelet over very easy.,Client,joy,undefined
He worked very hard on that thing.,Client,joy,undefined
It was really good.,Client,joy,undefined
So where did he get that from? Were you an inventor?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, no. No, man. I was a knucklehead.",Client,joy,undefined
My father was an inventor.,Client,joy,undefined
He invented this knife-sharpening machine.,Client,joy,undefined
It didn't make very much money. He was proud of it.,Client,joy,undefined
Alex reminded me of him.,Client,joy,undefined
In what way?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You trying to shrink me, doctor?",Client,joy,undefined
I'm just curious.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Or perhaps you can't help yourself.,Client,joy,undefined
That's probably true too.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
My father and Alex...,Client,neutral,undefined
"had the same mannerisms, the same sense of humor.",Client,neutral,undefined
It was unsettling.,Client,neutral,undefined
When Alex was a little boy,Client,neutral,undefined
and my father had been dead almost 20 years...,Client,neutral,undefined
There he was...,Client,joy,undefined
Sitting across the dinner table looking at me...,Client,joy,undefined
Through me with those eyes of his,Client,joy,undefined
on Alex's face.,Client,joy,undefined
"Is your father still living, Mr. Weston?",Client,neutral,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yes, his body is in good health,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But his...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
His mind is gone.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Were you close?,Client,neutral,undefined
"We had our differences, of course.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But we were close.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"We are close, I mean.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
How often do you see him?,Client,neutral,undefined
About once a month.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Does he know you're there?,Client,neutral,undefined
No. I don't think so.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But the visit is more for my sake.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What do you get out of it?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Connection,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
a sense of...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
belonging.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Do you ever have conversations with him in your head?,Client,neutral,undefined
Both sides of the conversation?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"When I was younger everything he said went in one ear, out the other.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Now I hear his voice in my head,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Loud and clear every day.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That's the sense of connection that you mentioned. That's...,Client,depression,undefined
That's what I feel slipping away,Client,depression,undefined
with each passing day since Alex's death.,Client,depression,undefined
That sense of...,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm trying to find his voice,",Client,depression,undefined
"you know, but...",Client,depression,undefined
He won't talk to me.,Client,depression,undefined
"If you don't mind me saying so, Mr. Prince, I think",Therapist,neutral,Approval
that it's still too soon.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You're probably still in a state of shock.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But his voice...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
will come back to you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I apologize for comparing what you do,Client,neutral,undefined
"to, uh, prostitution.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't believe they're the same at all.,Client,neutral,undefined
Apology accepted.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How would you describe,Client,depression,undefined
my son Alex?,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not asking you for a diagnosis.,Client,depression,undefined
"You don't have to tell me what he thought,",Client,depression,undefined
just what you thought of him personally.,Client,depression,undefined
I thought that Alex was...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
an extremely...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
capable man.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Strong sense of mission.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
A very strong sense of what was expected of him.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Uh, mission or purpose?",Client,depression,undefined
What do you mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, Alex was a military man.",Client,depression,undefined
Military men have missions.,Client,depression,undefined
"To have a purpose, a sense of purpose,",Client,depression,undefined
that's something...,Client,depression,undefined
"Something you do on your own, something you want for yourself.",Client,depression,undefined
Did he have that?,Client,depression,undefined
I think that Alex was struggling to find out,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
what he wanted for himself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did he say that?,Client,depression,undefined
"No, sir, he didn't.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm just giving you some of my impressions,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
without betraying what he confided in me.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Frankly, it's more than I'm allowed to do.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Were you in the service yourself, Mr. Prince?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Eight months, you know, after they drafted me.",Client,depression,undefined
Had an asthma attack and they discharged me.,Client,depression,undefined
probably saved my life.,Client,depression,undefined
"Funny, a breathing problem was...",Client,depression,undefined
"my salvation,",Client,depression,undefined
and my father's death knell.,Client,depression,undefined
Alex told you about what happened to my father?,Client,neutral,undefined
"These are facts about my life,",Client,neutral,undefined
not Alex's treatment.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you happen to know,Client,depression,undefined
how my father died?,Client,depression,undefined
Yes or no? Simple question.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yes. Yes, I do.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Anyway, I wasn't a war hero",Client,disgust,undefined
"like my son, if that's what you were wondering.",Client,disgust,undefined
How did you feel about Alex's...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
service in the Navy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

"I was proud of it, of course, like any father would be.",Client,neutral,undefined

Do you suspect that he wasn't?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I want to understand my son...,Client,neutral,undefined
"mr. Weston. And instead of helping me,",Client,neutral,undefined
You answer questions with questions.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think your son,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
found it increasingly difficult to,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"compartmentalize,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to keep his feelings,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
apart from his obligations,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and to live up to the expectations of others.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The expectations of the Navy?,Client,neutral,undefined
Expectations to excel,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
like he had always excelled.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And at the expense of his own needs,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and his real desires.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you saying that Alex was ill-equipped emotionally,Client,anger,undefined
To handle the pressure?,Client,anger,undefined
"Mr. Prince, you're asking me to...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm asking your opinion.,Client,anger,undefined
Alex's emotional state is not something...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You're playing a little fast and loose here, aren't you, mr. Weston?",Client,anger,undefined
"I can know my son was troubled, just not how troubled?",Client,anger,undefined
I want to know what his therapist believed,Client,anger,undefined
"he was capable of, how far he would go.",Client,anger,undefined
"How far he'd go to what, Mr. Prince?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I've spoken to a couple of Alex's fellow pilots.,Client,neutral,undefined
It was a training flight.,Client,neutral,undefined
"They simulate a battle, one plane against another.",Client,depression,undefined
"The other pilot made a snap decision,",Client,depression,undefined
"Tried to get away, apparently flying low.",Client,depression,undefined

My faith died...,Client,sadness,undefined

A boy once beat Alex up.,Client,depression,undefined
He was about 10 or 11.,Client,depression,undefined
He took his shoes.,Client,depression,undefined
"Little shit punk, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
Alex did nothing to fight back.,Client,depression,undefined
He didn't defend himself. He wasn't a fighter. He was a...,Client,depression,undefined
He was a frail kid.,Client,depression,undefined
You know? Thin-skinned.,Client,depression,undefined
And that scared the hell out of me.,Client,depression,undefined
"Where I come from, thin black skin could get you killed.",Client,depression,undefined
And that was the kind of world that...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That Alex was born into?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What are you implying?,Client,depression,undefined
I'm simply asking if he...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
No. Let me tell you something.,Client,sadness,undefined

Horrors.,Client,sadness,undefined
Did they...,Client,sadness,undefined
Did they affect my view of the world?,Client,sadness,undefined
Of course.,Client,sadness,undefined
Did they shape the manner in which I raised my boy?,Client,sadness,undefined
How could they not?,Client,sadness,undefined
Strength.,Client,sadness,undefined
Strength was essential to survival.,Client,sadness,undefined
Vulnerability,Client,sadness,undefined
was often a death sentence.,Client,sadness,undefined
I wanted him to be safe.,Client,sadness,undefined
I envy the time you spent talking with him.,Client,neutral,undefined
I admit...,Client,neutral,undefined
Those kind of talks embarrass the hell out of me.,Client,neutral,undefined
This where he sat?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Alex could talk.,Client,joy,undefined
"He and his boy, they'd talk for hours.",Client,joy,undefined
He even once told Roy that he loved him.,Client,joy,undefined
"Boy, I tell you...",Client,joy,undefined
Did I give him hell for that.,Client,joy,undefined
You're trying to make the kid a sissy or something?,Client,joy,undefined
It was bad enough that he didn't want to best Alex at anything.,Client,joy,undefined
He'd rather throw a chess game,Client,joy,undefined
just so's he wouldn't have to beat his father.,Client,joy,undefined
"Oh now, come on. That's no way to raise a boy to be a man.",Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, you have to challenge him, make him compete,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Teach him how to fight, take care of himself.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's interesting that you regret not being,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

You seem to justify being... being harsh.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I hear you saying that you're a little conflicted about the notion...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

Is that how you tried to help Alex?,Client,anger,undefined
Second-guessing every word that comes out of his mouth?,Client,anger,undefined
"A stranger,",Client,anger,undefined
completely unfamiliar with his background.,Client,anger,undefined
You go explaining his world to him.,Client,anger,undefined

about me listening to what... To what he had to say.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Yeah, well, there we go again with the listening, huh?",Client,disgust,undefined
He has his own personal professional listener.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Listen, when I smothered my father",Client,anger,undefined
"do you think I paid someone to listen to me, hmm?",Client,anger,undefined
You can't stop and dwell on every ache and pain.,Client,anger,undefined
Maybe it's because of what my dad did,Client,anger,undefined
or maybe it's because of what my mother did.,Client,anger,undefined
"Come on, you've got to keep moving, man.",Client,anger,undefined
You know? What good does all the talk do?,Client,anger,undefined
It's not gonna bring my father back. You know what?,Client,anger,undefined
People like you... You never stop to think,Client,anger,undefined
that we have a subconscious for a reason.,Client,anger,undefined
Because there are things about ourselves that we cannot face.,Client,anger,undefined
That we should not face.,Client,anger,undefined

You had to pick at the scab.,Client,disgust,undefined

That this was his fuck you to me.,Client,sadness,undefined
Why do you say that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
For pushing him so hard...,Client,sadness,undefined
To be tougher...,Client,sadness,undefined

I was so stupid.,Client,sadness,undefined
Did I kill my son?,Client,sadness,undefined
I killed my father with my own two hands.,Client,sadness,undefined

I tried talking to my mom all week.,Client,sadness,undefined
I just tried again in the car,Client,sadness,undefined

I literally can't.,Client,sadness,undefined

I don't even know.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's not just one thing.,Client,sadness,undefined
I just want to talk to her like--,Client,sadness,undefined
My dad's been calling,Client,sadness,undefined

most attentive father of the year award.,Client,sadness,undefined
I haven't called him back once.,Client,sadness,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,sadness,undefined

"Paul, stop.",Client,sadness,undefined
"I don't know, okay?",Client,sadness,undefined
I can't. Just give me a fucking break.,Client,sadness,undefined
Yesterday on beam...,Client,sadness,undefined
My legs started to shake--,Client,sadness,undefined
Like a spasm or something.,Client,sadness,undefined
I've seen it happen to some of the younger girls when they get scared.,Client,sadness,undefined
I've never been scared on the beam.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Cy was watching, so he'll probably pull me out of the meet.",Client,sadness,undefined

What the hell do you know about it?,Client,sadness,undefined
"Even if I do compete, how the fuck am I supposed to ace a national tryout",Client,sadness,undefined
if I'm shaking like an epileptic?,Client,sadness,undefined
I'll fall apart on the beam and become a joke.,Client,sadness,undefined
There's something seriously wrong with me.,Client,sadness,undefined
So we're going back to this then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That it's all your fault, that there's something seriously wrong with you?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
There is.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm all fucked up.,Client,sadness,undefined
In what way is that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

I ran my bike into a car.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Then as soon as they wanted to take my cast off,",Client,sadness,undefined
my neck mysteriously wigged out.,Client,sadness,undefined
Then I took your pills.,Client,sadness,undefined
And now I have some sort o a flesh-eating disease.,Client,sadness,undefined

Didn't your dermatologist say there wasn't anything to worry out?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

"You know, you're talking to your mother.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're not just berating her like you used to do.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're-- you're actually trying to talk to her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you are avoiding your father.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
These are extremely difficult things to do,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because you've never done them before.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They could lead to painful places.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Like telling your mother your father's secrets,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and telling your dad that you're angry with him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Don't you think that could be causing you a lot of anxiety?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And that your body is sending up these kind of,Therapist,neutral,Open question
flares in the form of a rash?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I'm almost certain, Sophie,",Therapist,neutral,Approval

I moved to the city and got a new apartment.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Everything was going really well.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

And then one day I was with a patient,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and for no reason my heart started to pound.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I couldn't breathe.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I had this ringing in my ears,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
when suddenly my tongue started to swell up.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So this patient called the ambulance,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and they-- they took me to the hospital.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Took me to this room, did all these kinds of tests.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You know what they found in the end?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What?,Client,sadness,undefined
Nothing.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'd had what they call an anxiety attack.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Guess I was more...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Overwhelmed and stressed than I thought I was.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think that's bullshit.,Client,anger,undefined
Does this look like a little anxiety rash to you?,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, doctor?",Client,anger,undefined
Hello?,Client,anger,undefined
"Look at me, you shit!",Client,anger,undefined
Am I that much of a freak that you can't even look at me?,Client,anger,undefined
"What's the matter, Paul? Am I embarrassing you?",Client,anger,undefined
Crossing your boundaries?,Client,anger,undefined
You want to disappear when somebody else wants something from you?,Client,anger,undefined
Do I still seem normal to you?,Client,sadness,undefined
Mm-hmm.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I shocked you.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're shocked.,Client,neutral,undefined
My titties scared you.,Client,sadness,undefined
How can they? They're just these tiny little things.,Client,sadness,undefined
Does the size of your breasts,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"upset you, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of coursnot.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's just what happens to gymnasts.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's the diet.,Client,sadness,undefined
When girls stop training they explode.,Client,depression,undefined

get full periods.,Client,depression,undefined
They become normal.,Client,depression,undefined

I'd say that you had the body of a--,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
A fucking freak.,Client,disgust,undefined
I have the body of a child.,Client,depression,undefined
But I'm not a child. Children don't want to kill themselves.,Client,depression,undefined
That's true.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Are you thinking about death again, Sophie?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Do you know why?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Because everythingis falling apart a,Client,sadness,undefined
it's what I'm trying to tell you.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's like that dream I used to have,Client,sadness,undefined
where the pretty Meadow turns to ash,Client,sadness,undefined
right in front of my eyes.,Client,sadness,undefined
Except I'm awake,Client,sadness,undefined
and I can't make it stop.,Client,sadness,undefined
"You know, I was remembering something that you told me.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
The time when you were in the ambulance.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You remember? You wanted to put the mirror outside,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
so that you could see what was going on.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You couldn't see anything except yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you remember that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
So what?,Client,sadness,undefined
"Well, I think sometimes when things go wrong",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"in your life, Sophie, you blame yourself.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Whenever a situation seems difficult,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you assume that it's-- That it's your fault.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You built this surrogate home with Cy and darlene,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and it fell apart for you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And you blamed yourself,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
not Cy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you decided to punish yourself,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
by riding your bicycle into a car.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"See, the thing is, if you see yourself always as the problem,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're going to create discord,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

Did it ever occur to you,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that Cy was the person responsible for what happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was my fault.,Client,sadness,undefined
But why does it have to be your fault?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because it is. That's the second time it's happened.,Client,sadness,undefined
You mean it's the second time your home fell apart.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But why would you think that that was your fault?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

I don't know. It just was.,Client,sadness,undefined

"No, but--",Therapist,neutral,Others
Stop it!,Client,anger,undefined
"You want me to have some big breakthrough today, I can see that.",Client,anger,undefined
Why don't you just tell me what the answer is,Client,anger,undefined
and I'll repeat it back to you,Client,anger,undefined
and you can put a Gold Star on my forehead?,Client,anger,undefined
What I'm trying to do is help you find your own answers.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And I think that you are,Therapist,neutral,Approval
really close to that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And I understand how scary that must be.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Have you ever read the bible?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Isn't that like illegal for you to ask me that?,Client,depression,undefined
Not really.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's really just a subject like any other.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You can choose to talk about it or not.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Anyway, in the new testament",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
God is always portrayed as being good,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and wickedness and evil is a human thing,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
a human problem.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Actually, it's one of the things",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that's helped christianity to spread very quickly.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Can you-- Can you think why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because people like to feel shitty about themselves?,Client,depression,undefined
That's it. Exactly.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
We prefer to live in a world where God is good,Therapist,neutral,Approval
and man is bad rather than a world where God is bad.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"So an evil authority, an unfair government,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
neglectful parents-- That's a pretty scary concept.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Makes your whole life seem,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
kind of scary and meaningless.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It is one of the reasons why children will blame themselves,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
before their parents.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You told me once that you wanted to move across the country,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"to be with your dad and his new wife, but that they--",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
They didn't have a room for you in her house.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said that they argued about it,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

Right.,Client,depression,undefined
How long did it take him,Therapist,neutral,Open question
to-- to leave her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

"And during that whole time, your mother was depressed",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"and crying constantly, yeah?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And you wanted to move to your dad and be with him,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but you couldn't.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Two years is a long time for a child,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to be without a safe place to call home.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I told you, he left her because of that.",Client,depression,undefined
"After two years, Sophie.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't understand.,Client,depression,undefined
How could he just stop loving me?,Client,sadness,undefined
What did I do?,Client,sadness,undefined
You didn do anything.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Isn't there a law somewhere,Client,sadness,undefined
that says parents have to love their kids forever?,Client,sadness,undefined
"You're right, but you must've screwed up somewhere.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Otherwise, how could they treat you like this?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"A father can't just abandon his perfectly normal daughter,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
swap her for a new famy.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
A mother can't just fall into a deep depression and ignore her.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Must be your fault.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Maybe if I had told my mother about the cheating,Client,depression,undefined
then at least things would be better with her.,Client,depression,undefined
"Sophie, that is not the sort of responsibility",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
a child should be asked to handle.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Your father cheated on your mother,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"you didn't tell her, then he left.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You needed that order of events to somehow make sense,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
so you blamed yourself,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
because nothing else made sense.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Sophie...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Listen to me.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You saw your dad cheating and you didn't tell your mom.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

I am so sad.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry I haven't written to you in a while.,Client,neutral,undefined

I Miss you too.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I wanted to tell you everything,",Client,neutral,undefined

I'm afraid from now on,Client,neutral,undefined
you and I must sustain rselous.,Client,neutral,undefined
What is it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I wrote sustained instead of restrained.,Client,neutral,undefined

On my night table.,Client,neutral,undefined

You're confiding in her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you're still hoping that your mother will notice.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You think I wanted her to find the diary?,Client,depression,undefined
I think so.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you wanted her to ask what you're hiding.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You said there, um,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement

Oh. It was september 11th.,Client,depression,undefined
Oh. It was september 11th.,Client,depression,undefined

What kind of a fucking idiot tells a fourth-grader,Client,anger,undefined

"If he really believed that,",Client,anger,undefined
then why didn't he do something about it,Client,anger,undefined

hmm.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So you're not picking up his calls?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
No way.,Client,disgust,undefined

they were gonna break up anyway,Therapist,neutral,Advisement

You are not responsible for your parents' actions.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
The only actions that we can control are our own.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement

So you want me to forgive myself?,Client,neutral,undefined

He was telling us this joke the other day about these...,Client,joy,undefined
These two cannibals,Client,joy,undefined
that eat a clown.,Client,joy,undefined
And one cannibal turns to the other and says:,Client,joy,undefined
Does this taste funny to you?,Client,joy,undefined
"Anyway, Amy and I are laughing despite ourselves.",Client,joy,undefined
It was very surreal.,Client,joy,undefined
Kids tend to do that when they sense tension.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They try to get the parents to come together.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You're probably right, but he shouldn't have to do it. It's not fair.",Client,neutral,undefined
You're right. It's not fair.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Amy's been trying to reach out to me this week...,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, make it all OK,",Client,depression,undefined
"the whole Ben thing, but how can you make up for something like that?",Client,depression,undefined
"To tell you the truth, it's pretty sad watching her try.",Client,depression,undefined
"When Lenny fell asleep the other night,",Client,depression,undefined
"she ran around the house, pretending to be busy with house shit,",Client,depression,undefined
"which she never does. Not saying anything, just trying to run into me.",Client,depression,undefined
"And at one point we were pretty close together in the kitchen,",Client,depression,undefined
she tried to kiss me...,Client,joy,undefined
And I just...,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Just couldn't do it.,Client,depression,undefined
I wasn't into it. My heart wasn't there.,Client,depression,undefined
It can be hard to relate to somebody...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
After something like an affair.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're telling me.,Client,depression,undefined
Bizarre.,Client,depression,undefined
"Late that night, she had...",Client,depression,undefined
fallen asleep watching TV and I just...,Client,depression,undefined
I just stood there looking at her.,Client,depression,undefined
How did you feel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She sleeps with her both hands,Client,depression,undefined
tucked under her cheek like in those kid books.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, the way they draw the angels sleeping.",Client,depression,undefined
She didn't look like a woman who had just fucked some other guy.,Client,depression,undefined
She looked really beautiful.,Client,depression,undefined
And I was thinking how easy it would be to just...,Client,depression,undefined
go lay down next to her and put my arms around her.,Client,depression,undefined
But you didn't.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, I couldn't.",Client,depression,undefined
I just remembered how easily she could chip away at me,Client,depression,undefined
and lure me back in.,Client,depression,undefined
So I jumped in my car and I got the fuck out of there.,Client,depression,undefined
In the middle of the night?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's right.,Client,depression,undefined
Where'd you go?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"First, at Elliot's,",Client,depression,undefined
but then I remembered he had a date. I didn't want to walk in on anything.,Client,depression,undefined
"It's been about 6 years since the guy got laid, so I just kept driving",Client,depression,undefined
and I ended up at my parents' house.,Client,depression,undefined
The kicker is they live about four hours away in Virginia.,Client,joy,undefined
"And it was too early when I arrived to ring the doorbell,",Client,depression,undefined
so I just sat out front in my car and fell asleep.,Client,depression,undefined
"How often do you see them, your parents?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Mom comes into town to see Lenny pretty frequently every couple of months.,Client,depression,undefined
"Maybe we go out there for the holidays a couple of times a year, not much more.",Client,depression,undefined
And is your father close to Lenny?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is my father close to Lenny? That's a good question.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I think so. They spend time together, Lenny likes him.",Client,neutral,undefined
But it always feels finite.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I can't help but get the feeling that he leaves him hanging,",Client,neutral,undefined
like he's just spent a few minutes,Client,neutral,undefined
with the neighbor's grandchild and now it's time to move on.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Of course, my dad, being the narcissist that he is, is oblivious to it.",Client,neutral,undefined
Has Lenny said anything to you about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No. He seems fine with it, so who knows? Maybe I'm just seeing things.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I was asleep in the car outside their house,",Client,joy,undefined
and all of a sudden there's this knock on the window and its wake me up.,Client,joy,undefined
And it's a cop.,Client,joy,undefined
And who's the cop?,Client,joy,undefined
Mike Garnett.,Client,joy,undefined
"Went to school with me, wanted to be a cop since the 1st grade",Client,joy,undefined
and now that's what he is.,Client,joy,undefined
It's really funny. He fulfilled his childhood dream.,Client,joy,undefined
I don't think I know anyone who became,Client,joy,undefined
what they wanted to be when they were a kid.,Client,joy,undefined
"When I was growing up, in the wintertime, there was this guy",Client,neutral,undefined
"and he would come over with his chainsaw, swing from tree to tree",Client,neutral,undefined
cutting branches before they froze and fell off,Client,neutral,undefined
like a fucking monkey. It was unbelievable.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he was the only guy I knew,Client,neutral,undefined
who my father didn't tell how to do his job.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's who I wanted to be.,Client,neutral,undefined
emm,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"The old man, he's such a know-it-all.",Client,neutral,undefined
"The funny part is though, he does know it all.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He can tell you the exchange rate for a Guyanese dollar,",Client,neutral,undefined
"how to cook a freshwater salmon in a clay oven,",Client,neutral,undefined
or the history of the silk worm.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does he write encyclopedias?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You'd think, right?",Client,joy,undefined
"No, he's a college professor.",Client,joy,undefined
"My mom too. Intellectuals. Big readers, unlike me. I don't read.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't think I've read a book since I left high school.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does that mean you don't or you won't?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I haven't.,Client,neutral,undefined
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I remember once I misquoted Roland Barthes,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and you corrected me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Where did that come from?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I grew up in a house where everyone was reading at dinner.,Client,neutral,undefined
That shit was everywhere.,Client,neutral,undefined
Any parrot could pick it up and spit it back verbatim.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's what happens when your dad is an emeritus professor,Client,neutral,undefined
of Renaissance studies,Client,neutral,undefined
and your mother teaches classics... Greek and Hebrew.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I don't read.,Client,neutral,undefined
I mean not literally. Obviously I read.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I read music, manuals, headlines,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I just...,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not like them.,Client,neutral,undefined
I do kick ass at crossword puzzles though.,Client,neutral,undefined
You do those?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not very good.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Sunday New York Times crossword does me in every week.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's a tough one.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know to do crossword puzzles, you need to have",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"an extensive vocabulary, no?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's kinda hard to reconcile the idea of somebody who doesn't read,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
with somebody who's really good at crossword puzzles.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
There's nothing to reconcile. I'm good at it,Client,neutral,undefined
and reading makes me restless and bored.,Client,neutral,undefined
So did you acquire your love of crossword puzzles from your parents?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not really. My mom's all right at them.,Client,neutral,undefined
My dad sucks.,Client,joy,undefined
What did you do as a kid when everybody else was doing all this...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
reading?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know. Play guitar,",Client,neutral,undefined
"collect baseball cards, smoke pot.",Client,neutral,undefined
Did that get you into trouble?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not really. Nobody noticed.,Client,neutral,undefined
Nobody noticed that you got high?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So who were you getting high with?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Myself mostly.,Client,neutral,undefined
So would you say that you had a lonely childhood?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nah. Why?,Client,neutral,undefined
It was okay. I talked to myself a lot.,Client,neutral,undefined
You know what one of my favorite things in the world is?,Client,neutral,undefined
Talking to Lenny.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And we talk about anything but mainly,",Client,neutral,undefined
we talk about sports.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he can just go off.,Client,neutral,undefined
Aluminum bats versus wood...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Fuck, anything. That kid has a brain like a computer.",Client,joy,undefined
He's not even 10 and he can list off,Client,joy,undefined
all of Boog Powell's stats from the 1970 world series.,Client,joy,undefined
That's just amazing to me.,Client,joy,undefined
I never get tired of hearing that little fucker talk.,Client,joy,undefined
You get like that with your kids?,Client,joy,undefined
"Not so much anymore because they're older,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"but with my youngest, yeah, I still do.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And how old is he?,Client,neutral,undefined
He's nine.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Just like Lenny.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you have that kind of relationship with your father as a kid?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I avoided talking to my father when I was a kid.",Client,neutral,undefined
It just wasn't worth it.,Client,neutral,undefined
He was the kind of guy who would wince if you said sure instead of surely.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you find it easier to talk to your mom?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She wasn't as bad, but what was frustrating was...",Client,neutral,undefined
she would always defer to him on everything.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's like she saw him as this hotshot professor,Client,neutral,undefined
at another level from everyone.,Client,neutral,undefined
He got tenure at 33 and it just wouldn't occur to her,Client,neutral,undefined
that she could have an opinion different from his... than his.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If you were him, you would have just corrected me on my grammar.",Client,neutral,undefined
If you were he.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hey, they didn't beat me, right?",Client,joy,undefined
It could've been a lot worse.,Client,joy,undefined
That's true. It doesn't...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It doesn't mean it wasn't difficult.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
So when did you start to write?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I don't write. My brother Nathan is the writer.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He's a novelist. He was just shortlisted for some prize last year,",Client,neutral,undefined
some big national award.,Client,neutral,undefined
I can't even remember the name. I'm sure my parents remember it.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you're a writer too.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Or don't you consider songwriting to be writing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, sure, I do.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Some of my favorite writers are actually songwriters,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"people like Dylan, Cohen, John Lennon.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Hey, I agree with you, Paul. I would put Dylan on par",Client,neutral,undefined
"with Walt Whitman, Ezra Pound, Langston Hughes.",Client,neutral,undefined
Just try telling that to my family.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, for somebody who is not a great reader,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
you seem to be pretty familiar with great poets.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Nobody's really familiar with Pound. They just fake it.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I get the feeling you like to play down,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"your knowledge, your intelligence.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't know. It's just my folks' world.,Client,neutral,undefined
I guess some of it has rubbed off on me.,Client,neutral,undefined
But it's just not me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Your parents ever expressed an interest in what you might do for a living?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
My dad probably wanted me to be some kind of academic.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's the family business after all.,Client,neutral,undefined
My dad probably wanted me to be some kind of academic.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's the family business after all.,Client,neutral,undefined
But what did he expect? I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think he gave up the dream on me,Client,depression,undefined
pretty early after I flunked out of high school.,Client,depression,undefined
"Which do you think came 1st,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
your father's low expectations or your low grades?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What you meaning?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Often with expectations,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you decided earlier on,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you couldn't match up to his expectations,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and so you gave up trying.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Could be.,Client,neutral,undefined
My mom was always trying to get me interested.,Client,neutral,undefined
She'd help me study for tests on the sly.,Client,neutral,undefined
On the sly?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, it pissed my dad off.",Client,neutral,undefined
He thought she was spoon-feeding me things,Client,neutral,undefined
I should've known or figured out by myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she was terrified he'd find out.,Client,depression,undefined
Was she... generally intimidated by him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You're so right, Abe. I never looked at it that way, Abe.",Client,depression,undefined
"Yeah, it made me want to scream.",Client,depression,undefined
"One thing you can say about me,",Client,depression,undefined
is I sure as hell didn't marry my mother.,Client,depression,undefined
You mean you didn't marry a woman who was intimidated by you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So how do your parents feel about Amy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She's a successful businesswoman, she's got an MBA,",Client,neutral,undefined
they fucking love that she went to grad school.,Client,neutral,undefined
Their high-school dropout of a son married a hotshot businesswoman.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's interesting you use the same word to describe your father,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
hot shot.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think that they're alike in other ways?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They're not. They're total opposites.,Client,depression,undefined
"He's all rumpled corduroy, stains on his shirt,",Client,depression,undefined
"and she's, well...",Client,depression,undefined
"Hell, you know what Amy is... Meticulous,",Client,depression,undefined
"put together, very materialistic. She loves her stuff.",Client,depression,undefined
"You know, when we met,",Client,neutral,undefined
I was crashing in this crappy apartment over a garage.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think it turned her on.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And the woman had never fucked on a bed without a box spring, and...",Client,neutral,undefined
she liked it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Coming down from her pedestal, hang with the riffraff.",Client,depression,undefined
Did you feel like your father was also on a pedestal?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Come on, let's get off this, alright? This is not why I'm here.",Client,depression,undefined
I don't have that many people to talk too right now.,Client,depression,undefined
And I'm scared shitless of losing Lenny in some custody battle.,Client,fear,undefined
Amy is...,Client,depression,undefined
unstable.,Client,depression,undefined
This is the second time she's getting a divorce,Client,depression,undefined
"after having an affair, and I think she's gonna fuck him up.",Client,depression,undefined
You said yourself she needs losers around.,Client,depression,undefined
I think she's gonna teach him to be a loser.,Client,fear,undefined
"She's damaged, Paul.",Client,fear,undefined
She's fucked up.,Client,depression,undefined
"I haven't gotten much right in my life except that kid, and that kid is...",Client,depression,undefined
What the fuck?,Client,depression,undefined
You don't pay your electric bill or something?,Client,neutral,undefined
Looks like it's out on the entire street.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You want to go on?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I can see you fine.,Client,depression,undefined
You're sure?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
For the first time...,Client,depression,undefined
It really feels like we're splitting up.,Client,depression,undefined
"No matter how many times we've talked about it, or...",Client,depression,undefined
"brought it up, it's never felt so...",Client,depression,undefined
Real.,Client,depression,undefined
Why do you think it feels different this time?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"The last time you were here,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you implied that you'd fallen out of love with Amy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Would you still say that's true?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. How would I know? What does it feel like?,Client,depression,undefined
I've only been in love with one girl... her.,Client,depression,undefined
I've never fallen out of love. Tell me what it feels like,Client,depression,undefined
and I'll tell you if I'm feeling it.,Client,depression,undefined
Have you ever felt it?,Client,depression,undefined
There's a huge sadness there.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Cause you know what's been lost.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you begin to lose the desire to...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
connect.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you should ask your father. He's the guy who knows everything.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did I tell you what he said when I told him my marriage was over?,Client,depression,undefined
"This isn't entirely unexpected, is it?",Client,depression,undefined
He expects me to fail.,Client,depression,undefined
Every time. At everything.,Client,depression,undefined
"Why did you go home, Jake?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know. It's an extend. I just started driving,",Client,depression,undefined
that's where I ended up.,Client,depression,undefined
This is therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
We don't believe in accidents here.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Alright, fine.",Client,depression,undefined
I'm about to be a single dad. Maybe I...,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe I just felt like I want to talk to my mum.,Client,depression,undefined
Or your dad.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Have you been listening to a word I say? I can't fucking stand my father.,Client,depression,undefined
It's interesting that you use the same words to describe,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Amy and your father.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Hot shot.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you keep insisting that they're nothing like each other.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They're not. Where're you going with this?,Client,depression,undefined
Look. You married an intelligent overachieving woman,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
who seems absolutely certain of her...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
authority in the world.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The criticism and disappointment that you got from your father,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
do me feel that that's what you get from Amy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Your relationship with Amy's falling apart,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so you get in a car and you drive for 4 h to Virginia,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and you find yourself...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
by accident...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
outside your father's house?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You think I was going back to the source?,Client,depression,undefined
"Jesus, that's sick.",Client,depression,undefined
It's not sick.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
The more we open ourselves to the...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"The therapeutic process, the more we can examine these...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
More therapy. What're you talking about?,Client,depression,undefined
I need that like I need a hole in the head.,Client,depression,undefined
You know what?,Client,sadness,undefined
Who cares why I went home that night.,Client,sadness,undefined
"What is it matter how my parents talk at the fucking dinner table, alright?",Client,sadness,undefined
I've learned from my father's mistakes and I'm a much better father than he is.,Client,sadness,undefined
I don't want to fuck it up.,Client,sadness,undefined
I don't want to fuck my kid up.,Client,sadness,undefined
I need...,Client,sadness,undefined
I need the help.,Client,sadness,undefined
I need your help.,Client,sadness,undefined
I need help. All the help I can get.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Or some road map, you know?",Client,sadness,undefined
I feel scared.,Client,sadness,undefined
I wish I could say it was that simple.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"That I could just give you a road map, a book of instructions, but...",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"unfortunately, life isn't like that.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"But you know, that old saying that...",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Or in my case...,Client,sadness,undefined
two steps up and one step back.,Client,sadness,undefined
"You know, if this was a movie...",Client,sadness,undefined
"the lights would come on, right now.",Client,sadness,undefined
If this were a movie.,Client,sadness,undefined
Were a movie.,Client,sadness,undefined
How do you think our sessions with Kate went?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'd say they were chaotic.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was a little annoyed with you over that but I suppose,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm partly at fault too.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I also think that she felt sandwiched between two therapists.,Client,neutral,undefined
I do have to say though,Client,neutral,undefined
"that you did manage to make connections that resonated with both of us,",Client,neutral,undefined
especially with Kate.,Client,neutral,undefined
Whether anything is gonna come off that I don't...,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't really know.,Client,neutral,undefined
You know who I envy?,Client,depression,undefined
Writers.,Client,depression,undefined
"let them live or die, or let them be happy",Client,depression,undefined
"or unhappy, let them be failures or successes.",Client,depression,undefined
You wanna write everybody's story for them?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I really think I'd be a shitty writer.,Client,depression,undefined
I'd want to give everybody a happy ending.,Client,depression,undefined
"Pual, I'm very sorry about your patient.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Alex, Yeah... Thanks.",Client,depression,undefined
Not the ending I would have written for him.,Client,depression,undefined
"The funeral, Jesus Christ.",Client,depression,undefined
I'd forgotten how awful funerals are.,Client,depression,undefined
That dreadful sense that...,Client,depression,undefined
"That in the end, there's only silence...",Client,depression,undefined
"You think as therapists, we'd have better tools to walk through it.",Client,depression,undefined
"Well, I don't. I feel the same sense of...",Client,depression,undefined
futility and hopelessness as the next guy.,Client,depression,undefined
You know what's also interesting is seeing the relatives of patients,Client,depression,undefined
you've treated. Their participance in the stories that you've heard,Client,depression,undefined
"a dozen of times, the father, the son, the brother, whoever.",Client,depression,undefined
We think we know them. But we don't really know them at all.,Client,depression,undefined
"We know reactions of them, the versions of them",Client,depression,undefined
idealized or vilified....,Client,depression,undefined
I was really struggling to reconcile,Client,depression,undefined
this image that I had of Alex's wife,Client,depression,undefined
with the woman that I saw there.,Client,depression,undefined
"He always described her as a demanding, exacting",Client,depression,undefined
a constant source of pressure in his life.,Client,depression,undefined
But I looked over and I just saw this...,Client,depression,undefined
broken woman.,Client,depression,undefined
She seems so soft and gentle.,Client,depression,undefined
'Cause I'll never really know her now.,Client,depression,undefined
Does that bother you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It does bother me.,Client,depression,undefined
I ask myself all the time if I actually know,Client,depression,undefined
what I think I know about my patients' lives.,Client,depression,undefined
"That couple, for example.",Client,depression,undefined
The one who were trying to have,Client,depression,undefined
the baby. Amy.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't think she can ever really be known.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, there are certain patterns that identified themselves",Client,depression,undefined
from her past.,Client,depression,undefined
But I cannot...,Client,depression,undefined
shrink her.,Client,depression,undefined
She's too complicated. And then I say to myself:,Client,depression,undefined
Do I really know any of these people?,Client,depression,undefined
Or are they all just one big fiction,Client,depression,undefined
"that I've constructed in my head, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
Sometimes I dream about the family members,Client,depression,undefined
of patients that I'm treating.,Client,depression,undefined
People I've never met.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yeah, it's curious.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Apart from your....,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"intense connection with your patients,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're also now talking about,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I don't know, longing for your patients' family and friends.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"What do you mean by that, a longing?",Client,depression,undefined
Maybe that's not the right word.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Do you mean curiosity about the lives of other people?,Client,neutral,undefined
Isn't that an aspect of what we do? It's just... It's curiosity.,Client,neutral,undefined
We're supposed to be fascinated,Client,neutral,undefined
by how people behave. At least...,Client,neutral,undefined
At least I think so.,Client,neutral,undefined
Alex's death left me with this very strong feeling,Client,depression,undefined
that I was like...,Client,depression,undefined
"a repository, really. A trustee.",Client,depression,undefined
"The things that he never told anybody else, his private thoughts.",Client,depression,undefined
"They've stayed with me, they're inside me.",Client,depression,undefined
A big part of his life is,Client,depression,undefined
is in vault I have inside me.,Client,depression,undefined
"No. A part of his life,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"maybe, but not necessarily a big part.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You were his therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Only his therapist.,Client,depression,undefined
I know you've always been of two minds in relation to this,Client,depression,undefined
that therapy is,Client,depression,undefined
"more than a discipline, that it's actually a religion,",Client,depression,undefined
"but you also say we're therapists, so we can't really...",Client,depression,undefined
"run our patients lives for them. As soon as they walk out the door,",Client,depression,undefined
"they're on their own, yeah?",Client,depression,undefined
How would you describe Alex's state of mind when you last saw him?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"I'd say he was pretty fragile,",Client,depression,undefined
"if I remember well, yeah.",Client,depression,undefined
"The ironic thing is that we'd really made some good progress, and he just...",Client,depression,undefined
seemed to regress. It was like...,Client,depression,undefined
He felt that he was so close to a breakthrough,Client,depression,undefined
"that it scared him. It was too much, and he just...",Client,depression,undefined

Are you feeling in any way responsible for his death?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

"that consults for the Navy, Alfonso Casilles.",Client,depression,undefined
You remember him?,Client,depression,undefined
Yeah.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Well, I asked him if he could find out anything.",Client,depression,undefined
He said vertigo.,Client,depression,undefined
It means that there's nothing wrong with the equipment.,Client,depression,undefined
They were doing some kind of combat exercise.,Client,depression,undefined
"The plane he was chasing descended,",Client,depression,undefined
Alex went into what they call vertigo and lost control.,Client,depression,undefined
That's their...,Client,depression,undefined
official conclusion.,Client,depression,undefined
I think he killed himself.,Client,depression,undefined
How can you be sure of that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Look, his life was a tragedy from the second he was born.",Client,depression,undefined
"His childhood, his relationship with his father, up to",Client,depression,undefined
when he pushed the button and killed a room full of kids.,Client,depression,undefined
How do you live with that?,Client,depression,undefined
"Even with the gadgets that they have now, they reduce people to dots",Client,depression,undefined
"on a video screen. All the spin from the Navy,",Client,depression,undefined
none of it made any difference to him. It didn't work on him.,Client,depression,undefined
"He felt every single one of those deaths, I know he did.",Client,depression,undefined
So many expectations...,Client,depression,undefined
The best and the brightest.,Client,depression,undefined
He was.,Client,depression,undefined
He was...,Client,depression,undefined
"so strong physically,",Client,depression,undefined
"handsome,",Client,depression,undefined
intelligent. Under all that...,Client,depression,undefined
kind of posturing,Client,depression,undefined
"and male posing that he did, he was really...",Client,depression,undefined
He was a good guy.,Client,depression,undefined
Charming.,Client,depression,undefined
"He was endearing, you know. He looked and he sounded like",Client,depression,undefined
what they call a winner.,Client,depression,undefined
"Suddenly, he becomes a murderer.",Client,depression,undefined
How do you reconcile that?,Client,depression,undefined
I think that's what really killed him.,Client,depression,undefined
Endearing?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I have never heard you talk about him like that.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Quite the opposite.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Actually, he was kind of a funny guy.",Client,depression,undefined
He was...,Client,depression,undefined

"idealizing? Yeah, maybe.",Client,depression,undefined
"Well, it's not uncommon,",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
after such a shock.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
He gave me the chance to stop him from flying.,Client,depression,undefined
Literally?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did he really offer that or are you projecting?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"He asked me directly, Should I fly?",Client,depression,undefined
What did you say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I told him I was very concerned about his...,Client,depression,undefined
About his state of mind.,Client,depression,undefined
You said that clearly?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
But he wanted me to say it unequivocally. Do not fly.,Client,depression,undefined
"It's not your place, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
A patient can't ask you to take his life into your hands.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
It's not your place to say; Don't fly.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Anymore than it's your place to say to that couple, Have an abortion.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Or to Laura, Marry or don't marry your fiancé.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I should have sent the Navy an evaluation.,Client,depression,undefined
Guilt-ridden. Wants to punish himself. Shouldn't fly.,Client,depression,undefined
Alex's dad came into the office to...,Client,depression,undefined
To talk.,Client,depression,undefined
"So I had this poor guy yelling at me, saying that his son's repression",Client,depression,undefined
was what had kept him alive all the time,Client,depression,undefined
"and that therapy, the stuff that he was doing with me, was...",Client,depression,undefined
The therapy was what had killed him.,Client,depression,undefined
"Oh God, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Up in the air at Mach 5, he's not supposed to have emotions.",Client,disgust,undefined
He's not supposed to think. That's actually why he crashed.,Client,disgust,undefined
He was very different from what I imagined also.,Client,depression,undefined
"He was riddled, you know, with his own guilt.",Client,depression,undefined
"Actually, he did make a couple of good points.",Client,depression,undefined
He said things were in the unconscious for a reason because the mind,Client,depression,undefined
can not live or breathe or take a single step,Client,depression,undefined
if everything that lies dormant in it were...,Client,depression,undefined
"out there in daylight, fully lay out.",Client,depression,undefined

would be like a cripple.,Client,depression,undefined

We help people to understand.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Understand what they're feeling,Client,anger,undefined
"and after that, if they make a wrong turn, then it's not our fault,",Client,anger,undefined
it's human error.,Client,anger,undefined
But...,Client,anger,undefined
Anyway.,Client,anger,undefined
Who're you really angry at?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Myself, obviously.",Client,disgust,undefined
You. Every therapist from Freud to Mitchell.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because we force patients to look at themselves,Client,disgust,undefined
and pat ourselves on the back for it.,Client,disgust,undefined
Because we force patients to look at themselves,Client,disgust,undefined
and pat ourselves on the back for it.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Then we say to them, Here's what's wrong with you,",Client,disgust,undefined
now off you go.,Client,disgust,undefined
Did you feel this way before Alex died?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"More or less, yeah.",Client,disgust,undefined
Has it been on your mind recently in any other context?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like what?,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm asking. Have...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"other patients, other than Alex made you think like this?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You're insinuating.,Client,disgust,undefined
"No, I'm just trying to get a sense,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
a history...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
of these feelings about psychotherapy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You mean, if I've been wondering for a while if our...",Client,disgust,undefined
profession is actually helpful to people?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Yes, I have. I think about it every day.",Client,disgust,undefined
So you feel you're not able to help your patients?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"The gymnast, for example, Sophie?",Client,disgust,undefined
"Honestly, I feel like she made a lot of progress.",Client,disgust,undefined
"We connected, there was a bound between us.",Client,disgust,undefined
But I think it was the personal relationship,Client,disgust,undefined
"that helped her, not the therapeutic process.",Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, maybe Yallom is right.",Client,disgust,undefined
Maybe it is the relationship that actually heals.,Client,disgust,undefined
"But that other couple, Jake and Amy, I can not tell you, honestly,",Client,disgust,undefined
if they're better off together or apart.,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't know if I helped them at all.,Client,disgust,undefined

"I think I'm tired, Gina.",Client,depression,undefined
Put your feet up.,Therapist,neutral,Others

they're supposed to trust their instruments and not their senses.,Client,depression,undefined
That's right.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
How do you know that?,Client,depression,undefined

I have been more than a sleepy spider.,Therapist,joy,Self-disclosure
So it seems.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, I think it's the opposite for a psychologist.",Client,neutral,undefined
I think we'd be far more effective if we relied less on,Client,neutral,undefined
instruments and theories and books and more on our own instincts.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So all your training, all your knowledge can lead you astray?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think so.,Client,neutral,undefined

I might as well sleep with Laura. I think that's kind of the way you're...,Client,anger,undefined
Is that what I'm thinking?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Am I wrong?,Client,anger,undefined

"He can't find it, he's walking in circles.",Client,joy,undefined
So finally he walks,Client,joy,undefined
"right into the middle of Times Square,",Client,joy,undefined
"taps a cop on the shoulder and says,",Client,joy,undefined
"Excuse me, officer. Can you tell me how",Client,joy,undefined
"to get to the Natural History museum, or should I just go fuck myself?",Client,joy,undefined
"I've heard it, yeah.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's a...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's a classic.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Well, she told it to me twice,",Client,neutral,undefined
and it wasn't funny the first time.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When I didn't go back, she called me like...",Client,disgust,undefined
"87 times. I was like,",Client,disgust,undefined
"Take a hint, lady.",Client,disgust,undefined
Do you think it's possible she didn't know,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that you had chosen to stop therapy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How many phone calls does a person need to ignore,Client,anger,undefined
before you realize they don't want to talk to you?,Client,anger,undefined
So you never spoke to her again after you decided not to continue therapy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I didn't have anything to say to her.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just didn't want to come back to therapy.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just wonder why you felt that you couldn't just...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
just tell her.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I didn't want to hurt her feelings.,Client,anger,undefined
The... Okay.,Client,anger,undefined
"First of all, the woman was borderline stalking me.",Client,anger,undefined
I've had friends who've gone to therapy at school and...,Client,anger,undefined
"And if you quit, they're supposed to call you once,",Client,anger,undefined
send you a letter and that's it.,Client,anger,undefined
Jennifer was,Client,anger,undefined
"way over the line. Second of all, she was an idiot.",Client,anger,undefined
"And third of all,",Client,anger,undefined
do you know her or something?,Client,anger,undefined
"No, I don't think so.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because you seem really invested in my relationship with her,Client,anger,undefined
and the whole reason I came to you,Client,anger,undefined
was because I didn't think that,Client,anger,undefined
you knew anybody that I know.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, I'm trying to understand what...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're trying to tell me when you tell me this story.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Dude, back up. I wasn't trying to tell you anything.",Client,neutral,undefined
You're the one Who brought her up.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can I ask you if...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
If anything else happened,Therapist,neutral,Open question
in those sessions that might have,Therapist,neutral,Open question
disturbed you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Oh my god.,Client,anger,undefined
I just told you the woman,Client,anger,undefined
had oatmeal between her ears.,Client,anger,undefined
She barely noticed me.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mentioned that my brother was autistic,",Client,anger,undefined
"that he took up a lot of my mother's time, and...",Client,anger,undefined
"she was like, That must've been hard for you.",Client,anger,undefined
Do you think you're angry at your brother?,Client,anger,undefined
"And I was like,",Client,anger,undefined
"I love my brother,",Client,anger,undefined
"but I could throw you off a bridge right now, bitch.",Client,anger,undefined
I don't understand you people.,Client,anger,undefined
I thought I could come here and...,Client,anger,undefined
"you know, somebody might actually listen to me",Client,anger,undefined
and instead...,Client,anger,undefined
All you want to do is waste my time talking about my first shrink,Client,anger,undefined
and what a fucking disaster she was.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't think we've been wasting our time.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Of course you don't.,Client,neutral,undefined
"All right, look.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"It may seem to you like I'm a bit slow on the uptake,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
but I really have been listening.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And I think I know a little bit more now about...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
what's important to you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You've told me not to tell you things twice,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"not to feed you platitudes, not to waste your time.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You've told me that you're fiercely loyal to your family,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"and if I fail to engage you,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"you'll disappear on me,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Even if I call you 87 times.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It wasn't really 87 times.,Client,joy,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
So what have you come here to talk about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How many people come to you with like,Client,neutral,undefined
How many people come to you with like,Client,neutral,undefined
a really big problem?,Client,neutral,undefined
Like what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know...,Client,neutral,undefined
"A death, a rape.",Client,disgust,undefined
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Anything that you tell me I can handle.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I wasn't raped. Don't worry.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm trying to tell you. I just...,Client,joy,undefined
I can't get the words out of my mouth.,Client,sadness,undefined
Can I write it down?,Client,sadness,undefined
Of course.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
How do you feel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Tired.,Client,sadness,undefined
What type of cancer is it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You know what? I...,Client,depression,undefined
I don't really want to talk about it.,Client,depression,undefined
I just wanted to tell someone.,Client,depression,undefined
I have so much other shit on my mind right now.,Client,depression,undefined
This project is due in two weeks.,Client,depression,undefined
"I have so much drafting to do,",Client,depression,undefined
"not to mention the model, which I haven't even started.",Client,depression,undefined
I'm so fucked.,Client,depression,undefined
Are you sleeping?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Not really, no.",Client,depression,undefined
I wake up in these cold sweats. They're pretty awful.,Client,depression,undefined
The whole bed is soaked.,Client,depression,undefined
Night sweats are apparently a very common symptom...,Client,depression,undefined
of lymphoma.,Client,depression,undefined
And other things you never wanted to know.,Client,depression,undefined
So how long have you known?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Five weeks.,Client,depression,undefined
And...,Client,depression,undefined
how did you find out?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I had a cough.,Client,depression,undefined
"It was totally minor, but it wouldn't go away.",Client,depression,undefined
And it was embarrassing to be sitting in class coughing all the time.,Client,depression,undefined
So... I went to the health center,Client,depression,undefined
and they gave me antibiotics.,Client,depression,undefined
"But they didn't help,",Client,anger,undefined
which is not really a surprise because the health center is total shit.,Client,anger,undefined
We have this joke that,Client,disgust,undefined
you could go in there bleeding profusely from your head,Client,disgust,undefined
"and if you're a woman, they'll give you a pregnancy test.",Client,disgust,undefined
So...,Client,depression,undefined
"you know, I figured I'd suck it up",Client,depression,undefined
and whenever I finally talked to my dad he'd tell me What to do.,Client,depression,undefined
Is he a doctor?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
In the army.,Client,depression,undefined
"He's supposed to be retired, but...",Client,depression,undefined
"Now he's working With the V.A.,",Client,depression,undefined
"and they're so understaffed, it's impossible to get him on the phone.",Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, where am I?",Client,depression,undefined
You were talking about your cough.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Right.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I couldn't reach my dad,Client,depression,undefined
and then...,Client,depression,undefined
"I started having these awful night sweats,",Client,disgust,undefined
so I went back to the center and guess what they did.,Client,disgust,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Accused me of taking diet pills...,Client,anger,undefined
or cocaine. The doctors couldn't agree,Client,anger,undefined
"on what controlled-substance abuse I was keeping from them,",Client,anger,undefined
so that was awesome.,Client,depression,undefined
Finally someone had the bright idea to...,Client,depression,undefined
"send me to Brooklyn Hospital to get a chest X-ray,",Client,depression,undefined
and then...,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, the rest is history.",Client,sadness,undefined
I have a big mass,Client,sadness,undefined
behind my spine.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Don't ever get a bone-marrow biopsy, okay?",Client,sadness,undefined
Just tell them to find another way.,Client,disgust,undefined
"They do it in front of 10 medical students,",Client,disgust,undefined
"and they're all flirting with each other,",Client,disgust,undefined
"as if you're not even in the room, you know?",Client,disgust,undefined
As if you're already dead,Client,disgust,undefined
and it's an autopsy.,Client,disgust,undefined
It sounds horrible.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Primary mediastinal large B-cell,",Client,depression,undefined
non-Hodgkins lymphoma.,Client,depression,undefined
You've met...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You've met with an oncologist?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, the same day I was diagnosed.",Client,depression,undefined
Were you alone?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You didn't want anybody to go with you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like who?,Client,neutral,undefined
A friend.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Or parent.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Hell no.,Client,neutral,undefined
How did your mom and dad react when you told them that you were sick?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I haven't told them.,Client,neutral,undefined
I haven't told them.,Client,neutral,undefined
So who have you told?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You.,Client,joy,undefined
Me.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Anybody else?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
A construction worker.,Client,joy,undefined
One of my biggest Pet peeves is,Client,disgust,undefined
"When I'm walking down the street, and some asshole at a building site",Client,disgust,undefined
tells me to smile.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You know? Like, Smile, sweetheart.",Client,disgust,undefined
It ain't that bad.,Client,disgust,undefined
"So... You know, I've always wanted",Client,disgust,undefined
to say something back that would really shut those guys up.,Client,disgust,undefined
"So the other morning I was walking to school, and...",Client,disgust,undefined
"this guy yells out,",Client,disgust,undefined
"Hey, doll face, smile will you?",Client,disgust,undefined
It's a beautiful morning.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And I shouted back, I have cancer!",Client,disgust,undefined
It was awesome.,Client,depression,undefined
Not really.,Client,depression,undefined
So the only people that you've told,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
about this are...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
this construction worker and me?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I wanted to talk to someone who was...,Client,neutral,undefined
"objective,",Client,neutral,undefined
someone who doesn't care what happens to me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You care I'm sure, because you're a human being, but you won't like...",Client,neutral,undefined
get hysterical If I tell you that...,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know. That maybe I don't want to get treatment.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, like if I tell you maybe I want to die right now,",Client,neutral,undefined
"right here, on your couch, you're not gonna...",Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know... Jump out The window, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
I just...,Client,neutral,undefined
need to think about all this for a moment...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Maybe see an herbalist, an acupuncturist or something,",Client,neutral,undefined
figure out what my options are before I start telling everyone,Client,neutral,undefined
and managing the hysteria.,Client,neutral,undefined
Who would become hysterical if you told them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Your mother?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Your father?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
And your brother?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Daniel doesn't get hysterical.,Client,depression,undefined
Daniel doesn't get hysterical.,Client,depression,undefined
"Violent, but not hysterical.",Client,depression,undefined
Violent against whom?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, nobody.",Client,neutral,undefined
Himself.,Client,neutral,undefined
Don't worry about it...,Client,disgust,undefined
You seem to me to be really...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
independent.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And I can imagine that the idea of...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
accepting treatment...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
putting yourself in somebody else's hands...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I can imagine that that would be kind of scary.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I just told you I want to explore my options... Meditation, yoga...",Client,neutral,undefined
"These are good Stress-Relievers,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but they're not gonna stop the progress of this disease.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Not according to Western medicine.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you come to me,Therapist,neutral,Open question
looking for somebody to tell you that it's okay,Therapist,neutral,Open question
not to get treatment?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do... Do you smoke?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Socially, a bit.",Client,neutral,undefined
This isn't lung cancer.,Client,neutral,undefined
There's an old adage...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
A saying that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the reason that smokers don't believe a cigarette can kill them,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is because a cigarette has never killed them before.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't understand.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm wondering If you really,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
believe...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that you have cancer.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I know I have cancer.,Client,anger,undefined
"Yes, but do you believe what you know?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
What else did the oncologist tell you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She said that I was at stage three and I should start chemo immediately.,Client,sadness,undefined
Do you trust her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,anger,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I just don't like her.,Client,anger,undefined
Could that possibly be because she was telling you,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that you do have cancer?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I just told you I want to look into alternative medicine,",Client,sadness,undefined
maybe a homeopath.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I just told you I want to look into alternative medicine,",Client,sadness,undefined
maybe a homeopath.,Client,sadness,undefined
Do you see any pattern between going to different therapists,Therapist,neutral,Open question
and going to different doctors?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you tell the other therapist about your disease?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I could tell she wasn't really interested in me.,Client,anger,undefined
And how could you tell that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She told me the same story twice.,Client,anger,undefined
"You know, I've been thinking about that story.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The man who needs assistance...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"He refuses to ask and refuses to ask, and then...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"when he finally has no other choice he goes up to the cop, but...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"instead of asking for help,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"he assumes the cop is going to insult him,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
he insults himself before the cop has a chance to say a word.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think it's really the story of a man,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"who's undergoing an intense internal conflict,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
a man who has a hard time,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
trusting other people.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was just a joke.,Client,anger,undefined
"But I'm just wondering if she told it twice for a reason, April.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Is it possible, do you think, that she really was listening to you?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She was a moron.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"That might be true,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but she may have been trying to tell you that,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"it's okay to rely on other people,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that it's okay to ask for help.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
This is ridiculous.,Client,anger,undefined
Everybody at some point,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"in their lives needs help, and I think that",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
you need help now.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You haven't heard a word I've said.,Client,anger,undefined
I think you need to have a conversation that takes place outside your own head.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I think that you need to talk to your oncologist.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I think you need to tell her that you're considering alternative therapies.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I think you need to ask her how she thinks you should proceed.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
And you do need to tell your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Just stop it.,Client,anger,undefined
You're at stage three.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Stop it. Stop it.,Client,anger,undefined
Stop it.,Client,anger,undefined
How dare you tell me what to do? You do not know me.,Client,anger,undefined
"What, did you formulate your little theory as soon as I walked in?",Client,anger,undefined
"Young girl, cancer... This is an easy one.",Client,anger,undefined
You have no idea what I am capable of.,Client,anger,undefined
"You're right, I don't.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Would you like to tell me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, I...",Client,anger,undefined
I have to go... Our time's up.,Client,anger,undefined
"April, I'm sorry that you felt I was telling you what to do",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"before I've gotten to know you, but...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but I do think that we should schedule another session.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Let me think about it.,Client,anger,undefined
How is friday... Friday afternoon?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"You know, I actually... I don't have my schedule this week.",Client,anger,undefined
I'll call you when I get back to the dorm.,Client,anger,undefined
When do you think that will be? I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
This time is very crucial.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
So I hear.,Client,neutral,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
What about the session?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"I'll call you, okay?",Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Dr. Weston?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yes. Call me Paul.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Walter Barnett.,Client,neutral,undefined
Nice to meet you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I didn't miss the elevator, did I?",Client,neutral,undefined
Unfortunately not.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"This way, please.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Is there someplace I could hang this?,Client,neutral,undefined
I can put it in the waiting room.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
No. In here.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's the trouble with having nice things...,Client,joy,undefined
You have to worry about them.,Client,joy,undefined
My wife bought me that coat.,Client,joy,undefined
"I never would have bought it myself... cashmere, English.",Client,joy,undefined
"I said, Honey, what's the matter with wool?",Client,joy,undefined
"She said, You're a C.E.O., Walt.",Client,joy,undefined
You're a C.E.O.,Client,joy,undefined
As if that explains everything.,Client,joy,undefined
We should get started.,Client,joy,undefined
How do you begin?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
What brings you here?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why don't you tell me what you already know?,Client,neutral,undefined
And we'll take it from there.,Client,neutral,undefined
What I already know?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I appreciate your discretion, but I'm thick-skinned.",Client,neutral,undefined
It won't hurt my feelings.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wasn't trying to be discreet.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You really don't know who I am?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, you're a C.E.O. with a cashmere coat and a wife.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That's all I know so far.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And two boys.,Client,neutral,undefined
They're on their own... launched.,Client,neutral,undefined
And a daughter.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So, you never read the business section?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Natalie, she's my youngest.",Client,neutral,undefined
"She's a junior in college,",Client,neutral,undefined
"whenever I visit, or visited.",Client,neutral,undefined
She's overseas now.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Whenever I visit her college town, there's this coffee place,",Client,neutral,undefined
"bagels, muffs, kids behind the counter with pierced everything.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And I noticed all the students and the professors,",Client,neutral,undefined
"they all read the art sections, the sports, politics,",Client,neutral,undefined
but never the business section.,Client,neutral,undefined
They had pristine copies on every table.,Client,neutral,undefined
The only news that really matters...,Client,neutral,undefined
and they think they're above it.,Client,neutral,undefined
And is that what you think I think?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, that's not what I meant. You're in a different line of work.",Client,neutral,undefined
"So, <i>tabula rasa</i>?",Client,neutral,undefined
Really?,Client,neutral,undefined
Is there something you would have liked me to know about you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That's not me in the papers. That's my company,",Client,disgust,undefined
although lately that girl reporter from <i>The Times</i>,Client,disgust,undefined
has stopped making that distinction.,Client,disgust,undefined
"But no, that's good.",Client,neutral,undefined
That's good.,Client,neutral,undefined
Let's leave all that Tommy Rot out of it.,Client,joy,undefined
A separation of Church and State.,Client,neutral,undefined
We can do that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I'd just like to be clear that if you do want to talk about your job,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
whatever you say will be completely confidential.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Is that right?,Client,neutral,undefined
That's right.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Can I get that in writing?,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, sit.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's okay. I trust you.,Client,neutral,undefined
You should feel honored. I have people working for me,Client,neutral,undefined
who've spent years trying to earn my trust.,Client,neutral,undefined
I imagine your position requires you to be very well guarded.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You're getting that from all those articles you didn't read.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I just know that you run a company, and...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
which leads me to believe that you're in charge of a lot of people,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
who I'm sure need all kinds of things from you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
All the time.,Client,disgust,undefined
It's like one constant meeting,Client,disgust,undefined
15 hours a day.,Client,disgust,undefined
And somehow I'm the only one with the answers.,Client,disgust,undefined
"If I ever stop making decisions, making calls,",Client,disgust,undefined
the whole thing would grind to a halt.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, I'm sure finding the time to come here can't have been easy.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
So what did you want to discuss?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"First off, it wasn't my idea to come here.",Client,neutral,undefined
"First off, it wasn't my idea to come here.",Client,neutral,undefined
It wasn't?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"It was Connie's, my wife.",Client,neutral,undefined
And what did she want you,Therapist,neutral,Open question
to talk about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sleep.,Client,neutral,undefined
I haven't been sleeping well lately.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think she's getting tired of me tossing and turning.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I said, Honey, it's a big house.",Client,neutral,undefined
I can sleep in a separate room like other normal married couples.,Client,neutral,undefined
But she likes to cuddle. So here I am.,Client,neutral,undefined
It sounds like you've got,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
a pretty strong relationship with your wife.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It does?,Client,neutral,undefined
"You've already mentioned her twice,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
both times referring to how she takes care of you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You seem to...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You seem to appreciate her a great deal.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, listen, don't tell her that.",Client,neutral,undefined
What else have you already figured out about me?,Client,neutral,undefined
You said that you weren't sleeping.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'd like to hear a little bit more about that.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"First off, I can't take pills...",Client,neutral,undefined

What kind of prescriptions?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"He wanted to try Xanax, Ambien,",Client,neutral,undefined
that kind of thing.,Client,neutral,undefined
But either they didn't work for me or they made me loopy.,Client,neutral,undefined

"They leave things in the sofa. I'll be reading or dozing off,",Client,neutral,undefined
and somebody's earring or a date book will fall out on the floor.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're sleeping in the living room?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's a good sleeping couch.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I made sure of that,",Client,neutral,undefined
in case Rosie or Max comes to visit.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did I tell you Rosie is looking at colleges now?,Client,neutral,undefined
And Max...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Max likes the Mets, which could be an early sign of masochism.",Client,neutral,undefined
I promised to take him to a game,Client,neutral,undefined
if he ever comes to see me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think it will work?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sure it will work.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You just need to take a little time,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"find some good restaurants for you and the kids to eat at,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
find some new routines.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"I don't think you'll be alone for long, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But I want to be alone.,Client,depression,undefined
I had my chance,Client,depression,undefined
at love last year and I blew it. I'm not taking that risk again.,Client,depression,undefined
That risk?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
The risk of seeing how happy I could be.,Client,anger,undefined
The risk of having somebody want me. The risk of being happy.,Client,anger,undefined
"No, thanks.",Client,anger,undefined
"The truth is, I'm still fucking angry.",Client,anger,undefined
After all these years,Client,anger,undefined
I thought I was coming to find out about your deposition.,Client,anger,undefined
Why did you come here?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I need some clarity,Client,anger,undefined
"in my life, Gina.",Client,anger,undefined
I need you to explain how I let this...,Client,anger,undefined
whatever you call it...,Client,anger,undefined
"love for Laura, blind me to the needs of my patient.",Client,anger,undefined
Alex used Laura to get me.,Client,anger,undefined
"By the time he was finished in therapy, I hated him. I really hated him.",Client,anger,undefined
I let my feelings for this...,Client,anger,undefined
Your love.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"All right, my love",Client,anger,undefined
"for Laura, which, by the way,",Client,anger,undefined
I never got to express physically or...,Client,anger,undefined
My love for this...,Client,anger,undefined
Beautiful.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yes, she was beautiful.",Client,anger,undefined
Stop putting words in my mouth.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"When you called, you asked if we could talk.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
This is how friends talk.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't think I have any friends.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's too bad you don't have a dog. You could mess that up too.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
God. Would you stop?,Client,neutral,undefined
"What do you want me to do, Paul?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I want you to tell me what to do.,Client,neutral,undefined
I want to know,Client,neutral,undefined
what to feel,Client,neutral,undefined
about all this.,Client,neutral,undefined
About all what?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Everything.,Client,neutral,undefined
Everything in my life.,Client,neutral,undefined
You don't know how you feel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know how I feel.,Client,depression,undefined
And that's why you're here?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I need your help, Gina.",Client,depression,undefined
So when you stopped Alex's therapy...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, he stopped it.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, he stopped it.",Client,neutral,undefined
He showed up at my door in a uniform. He'd already made a decision.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, when he stopped therapy,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
did you feel that the therapy had failed?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
Good.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
He came to me because he was afraid to fly.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he stopped therapy,Client,neutral,undefined
because he felt that he was ready go back.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you met his goals for the treatment.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And did you have different goals for his treatment?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, I did.",Client,neutral,undefined
And what were your goals?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, I hoped that...",Client,neutral,undefined
I hoped that he'd be able to forgive himself for...,Client,neutral,undefined
For what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
For what he did.,Client,anger,undefined
He dropped a bomb on a school.,Client,anger,undefined
Right.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And Was he able to forgive himself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. Do people ever forgive themselves really?,Client,anger,undefined
"I know we talk about it all the time, but do people ever really do it?",Client,anger,undefined
Sometimes.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Sometimes, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
How long does it take?,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
talking about something you're not able to forgive yourself for?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"What, like breaking up my marriage, destroying my kids' lives,",Client,anger,undefined
"wrecking my career, not being able to save my mother",Client,anger,undefined
and not paying attention to my father?,Client,anger,undefined
That would about cover it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you laughing at me?,Client,anger,undefined
Why not? We should both laugh.,Client,anger,undefined
But I can't.,Client,disgust,undefined
"So you go ahead,",Client,disgust,undefined
laugh at my mess of a life.,Client,disgust,undefined
Would you like a drink?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sure. Why not?,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's fun not having therapy, isn't it?",Therapist,joy,Open question
Is vodka okay?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, that'd be great.",Client,neutral,undefined
I only have soda.,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
That's fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, to...",Client,joy,undefined
To old friends.,Client,joy,undefined
And to Tammy Kent.,Client,joy,undefined
To Tammy Kent.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Tell me about Tammy.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I think I can say that I would never have survived my adolescence,Client,neutral,undefined
if it hadn't been for her. She was...,Client,neutral,undefined
She was my first love.,Client,neutral,undefined
Was she?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"And even before that,",Client,neutral,undefined
she was the only one who knew...,Client,neutral,undefined
Who knew?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Her family,Client,depression,undefined
lived down the hallway from us.,Client,depression,undefined
And the night my mother was...,Client,depression,undefined
She went to the hospital...,Client,depression,undefined
Anyway.,Client,neutral,undefined
Let's not talk about Tammy Kent.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Besides, she is...",Client,depression,undefined
She's your patient.,Client,depression,undefined
"So,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
can we go back to the lawsuit?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"After Alex's funeral, nothing more happened",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
between you and Laura?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"No, I couldn't even...",Client,depression,undefined
I couldn't even think about Laura without blaming myself for his death.,Client,depression,undefined
"If I hadn't been in love with her, if I hadn't been jealous of him,",Client,depression,undefined
if I hadn't been competing with him for her love...,Client,depression,undefined
you might have saved him. Is that what you think?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, I guess so.",Client,depression,undefined
You guess so?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Isn't that what we all want to do, save our patients?",Client,depression,undefined
Is that what you want?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
This is beginning to seem like therapy.,Client,disgust,undefined
We're friends talking about work.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Then let's...,Client,neutral,undefined
Let's talk about... the work.,Client,neutral,undefined
I have a new patient.,Client,neutral,undefined
Her name is April.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's just learned that she's got lymphoma.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's terrified,Client,neutral,undefined
and she's in denial. She hasn't told anybody.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Not her family, not her friends, nobody except me.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She says she doesn't want to have the chemo.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think she probably has an unconscious fantasy,Client,neutral,undefined
"that if she doesn't have the treatment, she doesn't have the cancer.",Client,neutral,undefined
You haven't said that to her yet?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She's not I don't think she's ready to hear it yet.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I don't have,Client,neutral,undefined
the time to get her there.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, with the particular cancer that she has, if she starts treatment now,",Client,neutral,undefined
"her chances of recovery are pretty good, but if she doesn't...",Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, if it was my daughter, I would just take her by the arm",Client,neutral,undefined
and I would drag her to the hospital.,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course you would. That's what you do for your family.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But not for your patients?,Client,neutral,undefined
This is the question.,Client,neutral,undefined
What does the good therapist do when the patient needs,Client,neutral,undefined
more than just...,Client,neutral,undefined
talk?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you just sit there and listen until she dies on the couch?,Client,neutral,undefined
You can only be responsible,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
for what happens in treatment. You know that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So are you saying that you wouldn't take her to chemo?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd do everything I could to get her to go.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And if she still refused?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm just afraid that this girl is going to die.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I can't get involved because I'm afraid of another lawsuit.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, Then stop being her therapist and become her nurse.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's not that simple. Don't simplify it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, are you saying that you wouldn't help her?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I thought that's what we were on the earth for, to help each other",Client,neutral,undefined
and step up to the plate when somebody needs us.,Client,neutral,undefined
How long have you been treating her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
A week.,Client,neutral,undefined
You've seen her only once and she's made you feel this...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm just afraid that she's going to die,Client,neutral,undefined
and I'm angry that she won't let me help her.,Client,neutral,undefined
Isn't this the same anger that you felt towards Alex,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
because he wouldn't let you save him?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
This isn't about Alex.,Client,anger,undefined
This is about April.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't think this is about your patients at all.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I know you don't.,Client,anger,undefined
You had this anger before these patients walked into your office.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're not gonna drag me down that path again.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm not dragging you down any path.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You think this is about my mother.,Client,anger,undefined
"Yes, I think this is about your mother.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't want to go into therapy.,Client,anger,undefined
How did you leave things with her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I made her promise to call me.,Client,depression,undefined
And I called her a couple of times twice yesterday. I called her three and 3 times today.,Client,depression,undefined
She still hasn't called back.,Client,depression,undefined
I just...,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, I have to help this girl.",Client,depression,undefined
"Paul, we're not gods. We can't save anybody.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You really care about your patients.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But I have to say you're no good to anybody,Therapist,neutral,Approval
as long as you are living with all this fear and anger.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Fear that I can't save them, fear that they're all gonna die?",Client,neutral,undefined
They won't all die.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, but my mother died.",Client,neutral,undefined
You can say it. Go on. Go ahead.,Client,neutral,undefined
"In spite of everything you could do,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
your mother died.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And if your mother could die,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the one who promised you she'd always be there...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She didn't promise me that.,Client,depression,undefined
But you thought she did.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, I thought she did. I did",Client,depression,undefined
"because she brought me into the world, she was gonna stay with me. As a kid",Client,depression,undefined
I thought that.,Client,depression,undefined
"She was sick, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She was too sick for you to save her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I wish you could tell that to my unconscious.,Client,depression,undefined
It was devastating.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"If you could have saved her, you would have.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you know what you're feeling now?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Look...,Client,depression,undefined
What if I wanted to come back to you...,Client,depression,undefined
"for therapy? No supervision, no blurred lines,",Client,depression,undefined
just plain old therapy?,Client,depression,undefined
You think you can trust me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You're the only one I can trust.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Besides, I'd feel really stupid if I had to start all over again,",Client,neutral,undefined
lying to somebody for a year. I don't want to feel stupid.,Client,neutral,undefined
What do you wanna feel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I just wanna feel...,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course I'll see you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Are you sure?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sure.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Is this time good?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"yes, it is.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm glad you came.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I sent you an email.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Thanks.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
But I'm just glad that you're here.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Do you have an iPhone charger?,Client,neutral,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You don't have an iPhone?,Client,neutral,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Do you have a blackberry?,Client,neutral,undefined
Not anymore. I used to.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How do you organize your life?,Client,neutral,undefined
I've got a datebook on my desk.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Kicking it old school.,Client,neutral,undefined
How was your week?,Client,neutral,undefined
I bet you still have a landline.,Client,neutral,undefined
Actually I do.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Great. Can I use it?,Client,neutral,undefined
Now?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Just for a minute.,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you like to wait till the session is over?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Okay, that's fine.",Client,neutral,undefined
Are you feeling okay?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
This... This happens when I get angry.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tremors run in our family. It's genetic.,Client,neutral,undefined
You must be really angry.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I guess so.,Client,disgust,undefined
I actually like when this happens. It's this weird,Client,disgust,undefined
"out-of-body experience. You know what'd help, I bet?",Client,disgust,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Using your phone.,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you like to tell me,Therapist,neutral,Open question
what's going on?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why your hand is shaking? Why you're so angry?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why don't you tell me why I can't just make a call?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, you can,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
but I just don't think that it's the best use of our time together.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You're sure it can't wait till the end of the session?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Fuck her.,Client,disgust,undefined
Fuck who?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Sienna Newhouse,",Client,disgust,undefined
Kyle's new girlfriend.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you know she has a publicist?,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm not quite sure who she is.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, I guess you don't really follow that world.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I don't really follow that world either,",Client,disgust,undefined
"except now apparently I'm stuck in it,",Client,disgust,undefined
mired in its peripheral muck.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Thank you for that, Kyle.",Client,disgust,undefined
I remember last week that you mentioned she was wealthy.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She's filthy fucking rich.,Client,anger,undefined
I told Kyle I had cancer and you know what she does?,Client,anger,undefined
She offers to pay for my treatment.,Client,anger,undefined
"We're at a school, you stupid cunt. We have insurance.",Client,anger,undefined
"If you ever actually went to class, you might know that.",Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, I told Kyle not to tell anyone",Client,anger,undefined
and he told herdeliberately so that he wouldn't have to deal with me.,Client,anger,undefined
I hate them both.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't get this. How does telling Sienna ensure that Kyle,Therapist,neutral,Open question
doesn't have anything to do with you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I told him not to tell her.,Client,anger,undefined
So he...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
betrayed your trust.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, it's more than that.",Client,anger,undefined
"Look, Kyle knows me, he knows what I can and can't tolerate.",Client,anger,undefined
He knows that if he tells his girlfriend I have cancer,Client,anger,undefined
"and if she calls me, I will hang up on her",Client,anger,undefined
"and never speak to either of them again, which is what he did,",Client,anger,undefined
"and what she did, and what I did.",Client,anger,undefined
So that's who you were talking to when you arrived?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And did you hang up on her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, the phone died, which is why I have to call her back",Client,disgust,undefined
so I can hang up on her.,Client,disgust,undefined
Could I just use your phone?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Please, it'll take two minutes. I can't concentrate at all.",Client,disgust,undefined
"She can't get the last word, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
I can't die and she gets to go on and live the perfect life,Client,disgust,undefined
with the only person I've ever loved.,Client,disgust,undefined
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Could I have a moment?,Client,neutral,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What did you say to her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,joy,undefined
I told her my life was none of her fucking business.,Client,joy,undefined
That made you feel better?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did... Did you talk to Kyle as well?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I'll call him later.",Client,disgust,undefined
You said that he was the only person that you had ever loved.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Can I ask you how it feels,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
to see him with somebody else?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I've never actually seen them together.,Client,neutral,undefined
No?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I didn't even know she existed until recently.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, I knew she existed... everyone knows she exists.",Client,neutral,undefined
Her father donated the money for the new library.,Client,neutral,undefined
She wears all these ridiculous scarves,Client,joy,undefined
in these absurd configurations.,Client,joy,undefined
You shouldn't wear scarves like that unless you're French.,Client,joy,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,joy,undefined
I just think they look stupid on American girls.,Client,joy,undefined
Including Sienna?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, not including Sienna.",Client,neutral,undefined
You said you told Kyle about your cancer.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I did.,Client,neutral,undefined
It was...,Client,joy,undefined
pretty funny the way it all went down.,Client,joy,undefined
I could use a laugh.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You want to tell me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"We hadn't spoken since we broke up,",Client,neutral,undefined
"because we're, like...",Client,neutral,undefined
radioactive together.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But a few months had gone by,",Client,neutral,undefined
I thought maybe we were ready.,Client,neutral,undefined
I knew he was seeing someone else.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I thought maybe we could have dinner, catch up.",Client,neutral,undefined
He always makes me feel...,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's older.,Client,disgust,undefined
He knows how to...,Client,neutral,undefined
"take care of things, how to keep everything under control.",Client,neutral,undefined
I sent him an email.,Client,neutral,undefined
I said I was having trouble with one of my models... which I was.,Client,neutral,undefined
He came right over.,Client,neutral,undefined
He could see immediately that I was tired.,Client,neutral,undefined
He made me risotto,Client,neutral,undefined
and he brought wine.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I remember thinking,",Client,neutral,undefined
This is nice. We can be friends.,Client,neutral,undefined
We are friends.,Client,neutral,undefined
"As he was leaving,",Client,neutral,undefined
he kissed me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I remember feeling confused, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
It was like it took a little while for my brain to catch up,Client,neutral,undefined
"with what my body was doing, where my hands were going.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And I heard this sound,",Client,neutral,undefined
"like a moan,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and I thought, Who made that sound?",Client,neutral,undefined
And then I realized it was me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"While it was happening,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I started to cry,",Client,neutral,undefined
and then he started to cry.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd never seen him cry before.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When it was over I said,",Client,neutral,undefined
I have something to tell you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He said, I have something to tell you.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And I said, You go first, and...",Client,depression,undefined
"So he said,",Client,depression,undefined
I'm engaged.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then I said, I have cancer.",Client,depression,undefined
That's so painful.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's him. It's Kyle.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm going to ignore this, okay?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
For what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He must've gotten your number from the ice queen's phone.,Client,neutral,undefined
She must've told him what happened.,Client,neutral,undefined
How do you feel about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I expected her to tell him and...,Client,depression,undefined
I'm glad that he called.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think that might be part of the reason that you were,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so anxious to call her?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because you wanted her to convey your anger to him?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I don't need to go through her to get to him, clearly.",Client,neutral,undefined
Have you seen Kyle since that night?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I kicked him out and told him I never wanted to see him again.",Client,neutral,undefined
Because...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because he told you he was engaged?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because he was mean to me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"After I told him I had cancer,",Client,neutral,undefined
"he got really anxious,",Client,neutral,undefined
and asked me what my plan was. I told him I didn't have a plan,Client,neutral,undefined
and he got angry and accused me of not taking care of myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
He got angry?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
His dad...,Client,neutral,undefined
"was physically abusive to his mom,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and she wouldn't defend herself, so...",Client,neutral,undefined
"So when kyle sees women not taking care of themselves,",Client,neutral,undefined
he goes apeshit.,Client,neutral,undefined
"April, do you think...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
And I know what you're gonna say next.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Gee, April, do you think you tried to provoke Kyle",Client,depression,undefined
with your apathy in order to get a reaction,Client,depression,undefined
"and see how much he cares about you and the answer is no,",Client,depression,undefined
I really didn't expect to tell him.,Client,depression,undefined
It just... It slipped out.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you know what I'm going to say next?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Actually, I think it's great that you see things from my point of view.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Really?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's really helpful.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, right.",Client,joy,undefined
Do you find it hard to let yourself be taken care of?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
It feels to me like,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you not only want to do,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"your own work here, but you want to do mine as well.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That way you believe you can get through this,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
without... without me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know, when...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"when you mentioned Kyle here first,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I was a little worried about him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You sound like my father.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, I guess I do react in that way.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You said that he was older, that he had a rich wealthy girlfriend yet he slept with you.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You can't blame him for that. I'm telling you, we have this thing...",Client,depression,undefined
"You can't blame him for that. I'm telling you, we have this thing...",Client,depression,undefined
I'm not blaming him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Actually, over the session, I think I'm beginning to understand",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
his behavior.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why?,Client,neutral,undefined
Because I think I know how he feels.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You described the way he responded,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to your revelation...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"to your cancer, as being mean, but...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
it seems to me that he was behaving appropriately,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

"You know, In the last session that we had you told me that you had cancer,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and as soon as you did that you started to push me away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And I knew that the more times I called you this week,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the less likely I was to see you again.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You called me like 10 times this week.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You must've never wanted to see me again.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"In the meantime, you told kyle",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and then you started to push him away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You vilified his behavior.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But he can't help me anymore.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He doesn't belong to me.,Client,neutral,undefined
He isn't mine.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So because he's not your partner, he can't help you anymore?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's all or nothing with me. It's just the way I'm built.,Client,anger,undefined
He didn't hurt me.,Client,neutral,undefined
He didn't hurt me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I hurt him.,Client,neutral,undefined
It wasn't his fault we broke up. It was mine.,Client,neutral,undefined
I couldn't take it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, what couldn't you take?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How much he loved me.,Client,depression,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
It was just too much.,Client,depression,undefined
You said that,Therapist,neutral,Open question
you couldn't rely on Kyle because...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
he doesn't belong to you.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is there anyone in your life,Therapist,neutral,Open question
who does?,Client,neutral,undefined
Right now?,Client,neutral,undefined
Daniel.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you and your brother have,Therapist,neutral,Approval
a deep bond.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Did you tell him about the cancer?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Daniel has enough to worry about.,Client,neutral,undefined
Like what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Like negotiating the world, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
Have you ever known anyone with autism?,Client,neutral,undefined
What's that been like for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No one understands.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's... every second of every day,Client,neutral,undefined
it is like he is in a foreign country where he doesn't speak the language,Client,neutral,undefined
and where everyone hates him.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's lucky to have someone who understands him as well as you do.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, well...",Client,depression,undefined
he didn't deserve what he got.,Client,depression,undefined
Do any of us deserve what we get?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
When Kyle and I were together...,Client,depression,undefined
"it's hard to explain, but it's like I would...",Client,depression,undefined
just...,Client,depression,undefined
"check out sometimes,",Client,depression,undefined
but I wouldn't go far.,Client,depression,undefined
"I would be watching myself, watching Kyle...",Client,depression,undefined
"brushing our teeth, making coffee.",Client,depression,undefined
"And I remember thinking,",Client,depression,undefined
This is what it feels like to be Daniel.,Client,depression,undefined
How often would this happen?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
A lot...,Client,depression,undefined
Especially when we were in bed.,Client,depression,undefined
"Sometimes,",Client,depression,undefined
we'd be having sex and then suddenly....,Client,depression,undefined
"I'd be floating above us, looking down and thinking,",Client,depression,undefined
"Oh, they're in love. That's nice.",Client,depression,undefined
It didn't happen,Client,depression,undefined
this last time.,Client,depression,undefined
"I tried to make it happen, but I couldn't.",Client,depression,undefined
I think that's when I started to cry.,Client,depression,undefined
It sounds like you were what we call,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
dissociating.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's a defense mechanism.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"It feels like you are outside your body,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but we do it sometimes to get away from something that we feel is,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
frightening.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What was I afraid of?,Client,depression,undefined
That's a very important question.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I slept with his best friend...,Client,sadness,undefined
Kyle's.,Client,sadness,undefined
I don't know why I did it.,Client,sadness,undefined
"The whole time there was this voice in my head saying,",Client,sadness,undefined
Don't do this.,Client,sadness,undefined
"April, please.",Client,sadness,undefined
You're gonna screw everything up. He won't forgive you.,Client,sadness,undefined
I did it anyway and...,Client,sadness,undefined
Then I told him.,Client,sadness,undefined
And I was right...,Client,sadness,undefined
He couldn't forgive me.,Client,sadness,undefined
Everything was really sort of perfect.,Client,sadness,undefined
I was,Client,sadness,undefined
this perfect girl to him.,Client,sadness,undefined
Did that feel scary?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Now I'm...,Client,sadness,undefined
"that girl,",Client,sadness,undefined
the one who's still hung up on her ex.,Client,disgust,undefined
I hate girls like this.,Client,disgust,undefined
You don't like to see yourself as...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"flawed, do you?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Kyle offered to take me to the hospital,Client,sadness,undefined
"to see my oncologist, schedule my treatments,",Client,sadness,undefined
and I almost...,Client,sadness,undefined
"I almost let him do it, because I...",Client,sadness,undefined
I wanted to see him again so badly.,Client,sadness,undefined
Isn't that horrible?,Client,sadness,undefined
What's so horrible about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I stopped myself.,Client,depression,undefined
"He's been calling every day since we saw each other,",Client,depression,undefined
like five times a day.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not picking up.,Client,depression,undefined
You are gonna need somebody,Therapist,neutral,Approval
to take you to chemotherapy.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"From what I understand,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you feel very tired afterwards.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I've been feeling much better lately.,Client,neutral,undefined
I give you credit.,Client,neutral,undefined
"April, would you rather die than be weak?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
It is very rare,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for this disease,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to go away of its own accord.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Basically,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that's unheard of.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I have been feeling better since coming here.",Client,joy,undefined
Did you ever have a...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"when you were a child, did you ever have a worry doll?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
A what?,Client,neutral,undefined
A worry doll.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You tell it your troubles,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and it takes your troubles away.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Maybe...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe that's what you think you have in me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You've told me you have cancer,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and now I'm worried about it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Now since somebody else is worrying,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you don't need to.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And since you don't need to worry,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you mustn't have cancer.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I have to tell you:,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
talking about this to a psychologist is not gonna make it go away.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You know, I...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I spoke with this friend of mine who's an oncologist.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You did what?,Client,anger,undefined
"Basically, April, he thinks",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that your delaying chemotherapy is a sentence of death.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You talked to someone else about me?,Client,anger,undefined
I didn't mention your name.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You had no right to do that. I came to you in confidence.,Client,anger,undefined
It would have been professionally negligent of me to do anything else.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I need to find out,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
whether your behavior might be suicidal.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Suicidal?!,Client,anger,undefined
"What would you tell me to do, April?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You've been telling me what to do and say throughout this session.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I cannot let you...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"It is my duty,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"my professional duty, to protect you, April, from self-harm.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I want you to promise me,Client,neutral,undefined
"that won't happen again,",Client,neutral,undefined
"that no matter what I decide to do, you won't talk",Client,neutral,undefined
to anybody else about me outside this room.,Client,neutral,undefined
I promise.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But you have to promise me something in return.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
"That if you decide to stop therapy, you have to call me.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You cannot sever ties unilaterally.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't want you to disappear.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I promise.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I'm sure this week you read up on me.,Client,neutral,undefined
You mean about your company?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I won't hold it against you.,Client,neutral,undefined
We've got a target on our backs.,Client,neutral,undefined
Moved off that business section you never read,Client,neutral,undefined
"into the front section,",Client,neutral,undefined
any day now there's going to be a feeding frenzy.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Actually I did read a few articles, but mostly about the industry.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Not specifically about you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Finefellow, fine.",Client,neutral,undefined
Connie thinks this reporter at <i>The Times</i> has it in for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think she's right?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, like you said, the whole industry is reeling from this,",Client,neutral,undefined
but for some reason Brenda Starr over there has decided,Client,neutral,undefined
to make me the poster child for the scandal.,Client,neutral,undefined
It got so bad this week that connie asked me,Client,neutral,undefined
if I'd ever laid off the girl's father.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you agree with her that this reporter is out to get you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Those articles... they're not based on facts.,Client,disgust,undefined
She's just listening to somebody.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I don't know who,",Client,disgust,undefined
some malcontent who has just enough information to sound knowledgeable,Client,disgust,undefined
and do serious damage.,Client,disgust,undefined
"So if I follow you then,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"this may not be a reporter's vendetta,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but it could actually be the work of somebody from inside the company.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, I didn't want to think that,",Client,disgust,undefined
"but the Donaldsons, that's the family with the majority stake,",Client,disgust,undefined
they're convinced of it.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Old man Donaldson said, Walter, we have a Judas in our midst.",Client,neutral,undefined
"That must be pretty disturbing,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
not knowing who to trust in the midst of a crisis.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, that's business.",Client,neutral,undefined
But what's really disturbing is for her to imply,Client,neutral,undefined
that I would endanger the health of children just to turn a profit.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, that's completely irresponsible.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I'm a father, for Christ's sake.",Client,disgust,undefined
Got a daughter who's probably reading about this online.,Client,disgust,undefined
Are you worried about how she might react?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She knows who her old man is.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I am worried,Client,depression,undefined
that these articles might be putting Natalie in jeopardy.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not sure that I follow.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, God forbid they find out she's my daughter.",Client,depression,undefined
For all I know they probably already have. Maybe she's already disappeared.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe they're stalling for time while he decides,Client,depression,undefined
how much ransom he thinks he can ask for.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think I sound crazy?,Client,depression,undefined
I think your anxiety might be influencing your judgment.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I'm not the only one.",Client,depression,undefined
Connie's allergies are acting up. She's losing weight.,Client,depression,undefined
Or maybe she's worried for you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Me?,Client,disgust,undefined
About what?,Client,disgust,undefined
My job?,Client,disgust,undefined
"No, that reporter from The Times who's trying to get me fired,",Client,disgust,undefined
she's the one who should be worried.,Client,disgust,undefined
Or do I sound crazy?,Client,disgust,undefined
Actually I think you sound quite confident,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for a man in the midst of a... what did you call it?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
A feeding frenzy?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, there's a reason for that...",Client,neutral,undefined
the Donaldsons.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've worked for them for over 35 years.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm like a son to them.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can I ask you what you're thinking about now?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
That's right.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're the fellow who wants me to say whatever pops into my head.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was just thinking... they had a son.,Client,neutral,undefined
James.,Client,neutral,undefined
We were in the war together...,Client,neutral,undefined
army corps of engineers.,Client,neutral,undefined
"We tried to build bridges over there,",Client,neutral,undefined
helping people who were taking shots at us.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When we got back to the States,",Client,neutral,undefined
I got my degree and he brought me into the company.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If I'd looked out for him as much over here as we did for each other over there,",Client,depression,undefined
he might still be around.,Client,depression,undefined
What happened to him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He drove too fast.,Client,depression,undefined
You see a family through a loss like that and they're not gonna...,Client,neutral,undefined
this crisis'll blow over. They always do.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think I've talked enough.,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you mind telling me what you're thinking?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, just now I was struck by the way you said that the...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
the crisis would blow over.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It reminded me of what you said last week as... as you were leaving.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What did I say?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I asked you if you should call your doctor, and you said it'll go away.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It always goes away.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, last week.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, I think I also said I was sorry if I gave you a scare.",Client,neutral,undefined
"But... these things, they look worse than they are.",Client,neutral,undefined
And what are they exactly?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, whatever they are, they're not going to kill me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"They're inconvenient, sure,",Client,neutral,undefined
but they go away.,Client,neutral,undefined
And have you ever mentioned them to anyone?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I have a gold-plated executive health plan.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't really need it, but the company insists on it.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If there's anything wrong a problem, they would have found out.",Client,neutral,undefined
"So you told your doctor that you were having trouble sleeping,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
but you didn't say anything about the panic attacks.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
They're not panic attacks.,Client,neutral,undefined
What makes you so sure?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They don't happen under stressful situations.,Client,anger,undefined
"They happen at dinner sometimes, or a movie.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Or, evidently, during a therapy session.",Client,neutral,undefined
Have you had one since then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Actually I had one this week in the elevator, of all places.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Actually I had one this week in the elevator, of all places.",Client,neutral,undefined
Would you care to tell me about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"What do you want me to do, describe the elevator for you?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, did anything unusual happen that morning?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why don't you just describe then...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
the details of that morning as you remember?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
This is like the game my wife used to play,Client,disgust,undefined
with our kids at the dinner table.,Client,disgust,undefined
"We'd ask them how school was, they'd say, fine.",Client,disgust,undefined
Ask them what happened... nothing.,Client,disgust,undefined
Finally my wife made them walk through the day step by step.,Client,disgust,undefined
Is that really what you're looking for?,Client,disgust,undefined
Humor me.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Okay, got out of the town car, went into the building,",Client,anger,undefined
"met the new security guard,",Client,anger,undefined
"showed him my passport, went through the gates,",Client,anger,undefined
"got on the elevator,",Client,anger,undefined
"my heart started racing,",Client,anger,undefined
"my throat closed up,",Client,anger,undefined
"elevator doors opened, went into my office.",Client,anger,undefined
"This is about the time that Natalie would usually say,",Client,anger,undefined
can I be excused now?,Client,anger,undefined
Are you saying that Do you find this exercise pointless?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I don't mean to be a doubting Thomas,",Client,anger,undefined
"I don't mean to be a doubting Thomas,",Client,anger,undefined
"but I don't see anything that would have caused a panic attack, do you?",Client,anger,undefined
You said there was a new security guard.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, a kid. What about him?",Client,anger,undefined
Anything unusual about... that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Did it upset you? Maybe, that you had to show him your I.D.?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You don't know me at all.,Client,anger,undefined
I knew Bob for over 30 years,Client,anger,undefined
and I always made a point of showing him my I.D.,Client,anger,undefined
And what happened to Bob?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"He died, according to the kid.",Client,neutral,undefined
Dropped dead of heart failure.,Client,neutral,undefined
Disappeared.,Client,neutral,undefined
Were you and Bob close?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'd nod to him in the morning.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He'd say, Hey, Mr. B, how about those Knicks?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'd say, They're breaking my heart, Bob.",Client,neutral,undefined
And just same conversation for 30 years.,Client,neutral,undefined
It sounds like you two had a morning ritual.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you think that you miss him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't miss Bob.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I enjoyed our banter and I feel sorry for his family, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
He meant nothing to me.,Client,joy,undefined
I just wonder if there might be some connection between Bob's death,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"your attack in the elevator, that's all.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I think you're grasping for straws there, fella.",Client,disgust,undefined
Where did you go to school?,Client,neutral,undefined
Here.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
In the city.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Are you worried I'm not qualified to treat you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was just a question.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, it doesn't matter. Like I said, I've had these since I was a kid.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm used to them.,Client,neutral,undefined
From when you were a kid?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Off and on.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you remember how old you were when you experienced your first one?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Four or five, I guess.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Four or five, that seems very young.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Right...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Six.,Client,neutral,undefined

Were you close...,Therapist,neutral,Open question

He died when I was a boy.,Client,neutral,undefined
He drowned.,Client,sadness,undefined
How did it happen?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, this was in rural Pennsylvania.",Client,depression,undefined
It was an old limestone quarry lake.,Client,depression,undefined
A swimming hole really.,Client,depression,undefined
40 foot cliffs.,Client,depression,undefined
It was a hot summer night.,Client,depression,undefined
And what age was he?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
16,Client,neutral,undefined
Getting ready to go to college in the fall... Yale.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He seemed kinda young for that, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
he skipped a few grades.,Client,neutral,undefined

Fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't even know if I really knew that was going on, I was so young.",Client,neutral,undefined
And your parents...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How did they... How did they grieve?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They didn't.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Of course they did. They had to, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
they shielded me from that.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you knew something was going on?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
All I know is that one day Tommy just wasn't there.,Client,depression,undefined
I think I stayed with the neighbors for a few nights. And then...,Client,depression,undefined
I went home.,Client,depression,undefined
"My dad was sitting on the porch, drinking his lager, waiting for me.",Client,depression,undefined
He walked me up to my brother's room.,Client,depression,undefined
All his stuff was still there.,Client,depression,undefined
Nothing changed.,Client,depression,undefined
"My father said, This is yours now.",Client,depression,undefined
I just told your mother now I know why we had you.,Client,depression,undefined
Then he turns around and leaves me there.,Client,depression,undefined
Or at least that's how I remember it.,Client,depression,undefined
It's a very...,Therapist,neutral,Approval

I just feel sorry for the old man.,Client,depression,undefined
I just feel sorry for the old man.,Client,depression,undefined
Tommy was everything to him.,Client,depression,undefined
And your mother? How did she react?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Her hair turned white.,Client,depression,undefined
She had this gorgeous auburn hair.,Client,depression,undefined
And then overnight...,Client,depression,undefined
she changed into an old woman.,Client,depression,undefined
I thought she was a changeling for a while.,Client,depression,undefined
That my real mother was... trapped somewhere,Client,depression,undefined
far away.,Client,depression,undefined
"Walter, what...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What you're talking about...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

It must have been...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
hard for you...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
to cope with the loss of your brother and your parents' grief.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Kids are resilient. They survive.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you began to have these attacks,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
after you were sleeping in Tommy's room.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I did. So what?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Like I said, they only occurred while I was sleeping.",Client,neutral,undefined
And... what were they like back then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'd wake up sweating and shaking.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you ever tell your parents?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, they had enough on their minds.",Client,depression,undefined
"And these panic attacks, just like now, they would go away.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
There you go again with this panic. Haven't you been listening?,Client,anger,undefined
How could they be panic attacks? They happened when I was asleep.,Client,anger,undefined
How stressed out could I have been?,Client,anger,undefined
"As a child whose brother had just vanished, and whose parents",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"offered no explanation, I think, you could have been very stressed out",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
even in your dreams.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Especially in your dreams.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it sounds to me like your parents placed a heavy burden on you after Tommy died.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did you ever feel that they wanted you to fulfill his potential?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Nobody could ever fulfill Tommy's potential. But I tried.,Client,neutral,undefined
I did try.,Client,neutral,undefined
You are a very successful man.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm ROTC from Penn state.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tommy had an Ivy League scholarship.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tommy would have cured cancer.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think about Tommy a lot?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"But actually, I've...",Client,neutral,undefined
been thinking about what it must have been like for my folks,Client,neutral,undefined

They'd already lost one and their only spare was halfway around the world.,Client,neutral,undefined
I must have put them through hell.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did they ever say anything to you about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, like I said, they...",Client,neutral,undefined
They didn't talk a lot about their feelings.,Client,neutral,undefined

You said he disappeared. It's the same word,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you used to talk about what you fear may have happened to Natalie.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

"read into things, or suggest another way of looking at a problem,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you've shut me down.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's not that.,Client,disgust,undefined
"It's just that if you're wrong, you're wrong.",Client,disgust,undefined
Am I supposed I have to worry about your feelings?,Client,disgust,undefined
Of course not.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But I'm supposed to pay attention to yours,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and you've given me the strong sense, I have to say,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that if I tell you something you don't want to hear,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you might very well just walk out of the room.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You mean fire you.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, you're wrong about that too.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Look, if you think I need to hear something just",Client,disgust,undefined
come on out and say it. I'm a big boy.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You think Bob the security guard is my rosebud,",Client,disgust,undefined
tell me how.,Client,disgust,undefined
Actually I think this precedes,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Bob and Natalie.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Go on.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't think that you trust that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
people who leave you will ever come back.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Your brother never returned.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Your mother looking like a different person.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Your father was never the same.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And nobody made sense of it all for you... as a kid.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Perhaps you still fear,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that if someone...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
disappears...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"even momentarily, whether they're...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
overseas or just out of touch for a few days.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That something horrible must have happened to them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Perhaps in certain situations, you experience",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
a disproportionately stressful response.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So if I'm understanding you,",Client,neutral,undefined
all this started when my daughter left for Rwanda.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's an overreaction, like my wife's allergies.",Client,neutral,undefined
Does that make sense to you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you have some sort of psychological antihistamine?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you mean a prescription?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I thought you said you didn't want to take pills.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Maybe that was because my doctor didn't have your diagnosis.,Client,neutral,undefined
There is medication for panic attacks.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I think...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it's really important,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that we continue the work that we're beginning to do here.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Call my doctor.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tell him what you think.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'll do that.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Good.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Thanks, I appreciate it.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Our time's up, isn't it?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, it is.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"You can pay me at the end of the month, if you...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"If you don't mind, one thing I learned from my father,",Client,neutral,undefined
pay as you go.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's cleaner that way.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe the medication will help.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tammy looked like she had a good session today.,Client,neutral,undefined
We can't talk about another patient. You said that last week.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I said a lot of things last week,Client,neutral,undefined
and the truth is I don't know what I was thinking.,Client,neutral,undefined
Look. I can't be in therapy with you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, It's nothing personal.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If I were to go to therapy, obviously I would come to you, of course.",Client,neutral,undefined
But it's just not a good time for me to...,Client,neutral,undefined
to make myself more miserable.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Is that what we were going to do, make you more miserable?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I didn't want to just phone, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined
Are you sure about this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Absolutely.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry to hear this.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But I respect your decision, so.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You respect my decision?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, of course I do.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you want me to leave?,Client,neutral,undefined
You stay here and wait for the kids.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's fine.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"But since I've got some free time, I need to do some shopping.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You're going shopping?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you need anything from the market?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"What would I need from the market, Gina?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, right. I don't know.",Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
Did you want me to argue with you?,Therapist,joy,Open question
Do you want me to persuade you to come to therapy?,Therapist,joy,Open question
"Did you want me to just, like, leave you a message?",Client,disgust,undefined
"No, This is very polite. I'm gonna...",Therapist,joy,Interpretation
We can't have an hour of conversation?,Client,anger,undefined
That's what we did last week.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'll pay you for an hour of conversation.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't sell my conversations.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe we should charge them.,Client,anger,undefined
If anyone learns anything it'd be all the better.,Client,anger,undefined
"So, are you gonna stay here while I'm gone?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I get what you're doing.,Client,anger,undefined
What am I doing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Women, they're all the same, every last one of them.",Client,anger,undefined
Excuse me?,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
Maybe it's not a good idea for you to stay here.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
I just want you to stay and talk.,Client,anger,undefined
You said that.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"10 minutes,",Client,anger,undefined
please.,Client,anger,undefined
"You don't know what kind of a week I've had, Gina.",Client,anger,undefined
"I've got this CEO guy, he pays me by the insight.",Client,anger,undefined
When I give him the insight he doesn't want...,Client,anger,undefined
I really loathe people who think they can just buy whatever they want.,Client,anger,undefined
Then I've got this former patient who I haven't seen for 20 years,Client,anger,undefined
who thinks that everything that's happened in the meantime is my fault.,Client,anger,undefined
"I just want to rest for a few minutes, that's all.",Client,anger,undefined
Just a few minutes though.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You can't get any rest on the train?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"On the train I talk to you, but you don't talk back.",Client,depression,undefined
"Not just you, I talk to all the people I don't see all week.",Client,depression,undefined
Like Kate and the boys.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And Rosie.,Client,depression,undefined
And this week I talked to Tammy Kent.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why am I thinking about Tammy Kent all the time?,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I was so happy at her house when I was 17.,Client,depression,undefined
"Was that the last time I was happy, I wonder.",Client,depression,undefined
"I don't think so, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What was it about being at her home that made me so happy?,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Maybe that's something you could work on in therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I could also work on why I say such stupid things about women.,Client,disgust,undefined
"That women are all the same, what a stupid thing to say.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Please, forgive me.",Client,disgust,undefined
People say stupid things when they're angry.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Anger is also a good thing you could work on in therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I called my lawyer from the train.,Client,depression,undefined
It turns out that Mr. Prince's lawyers are...,Client,depression,undefined
They're deposing Laura today.,Client,depression,undefined
She had a relationship with Alex.,Client,depression,undefined
"I know she had a relationship with Alex, while she was in love with you.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's a dangerous triangle.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Are you worried that she'll use this as a way to get back at you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know what she'll say.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe she really thinks that it is my fault that Alex is dead.,Client,depression,undefined
That's another good thing to work out here.,Client,depression,undefined
Fine.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm like my patients, you know. I don't want to be in therapy,",Client,depression,undefined
because I don't want to talk about my parents. My past is fine.,Client,depression,undefined
It's the present that causes the problems.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm like my patients, you know. I don't want to be in therapy,",Client,depression,undefined
because I don't want to talk about my parents. My past is fine.,Client,depression,undefined
It's the present that causes the problems.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm sure it's occurred to you, Paul, that...",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
That why you're thinking about Tammy so much...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Nothing has occurred to me. Why do you think I'm here?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
Please...,Client,neutral,undefined
Tell me what's occurred to you.,Client,depression,undefined
It occurred to me that you're interested in Tammy Kent,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because there's something incomplete,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in your understanding of your father's abandonment,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and your mother's breakdown.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And how does Tammy fit into this?,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Can't you guess?,Client,depression,undefined
There's an idea. Guess therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You tell me a problem you have,",Therapist,joy,Interpretation
"and I'll try to guess what caused it and if I guess right,",Therapist,joy,Interpretation
I win!,Therapist,joy,Interpretation
The only problem is I'd have to know what caused my problem,Client,joy,undefined
in order to say whether you were right.,Client,joy,undefined
"All right, true.",Therapist,joy,Approval
Yes...,Client,neutral,undefined
It had occurred to me too that my response to Tammy Kent,Client,depression,undefined
was tied up with my mother's death somehow.,Client,depression,undefined
That seeing Tammy opened a kind of a window onto that time.,Client,depression,undefined
"Suddenly with Tammy there,",Client,depression,undefined
"I felt I had to look in,",Client,depression,undefined
"you know, I think,",Client,depression,undefined
to see myself...,Client,depression,undefined
Before the fall maybe.,Client,depression,undefined
And Tammy and I were lovers...,Client,depression,undefined
And I'd want to talk about that too.,Client,depression,undefined
But I can't talk about Tammy because she's your patient.,Client,depression,undefined
So...,Client,depression,undefined
"I don't know, maybe I'll just take Tammy out for a coffee sometime,",Client,depression,undefined
but I won't go looking in the...,Client,depression,undefined
In the mother window. I'll just...,Client,depression,undefined
Let it all stay,Client,depression,undefined
dead.,Client,depression,undefined
The problem is it's not dead.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's the...,Client,neutral,undefined
Undead.,Client,neutral,undefined
Like in a horror movie.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You kill it, you bury it, but then it comes right back,",Client,neutral,undefined
right out of the grave.,Client,neutral,undefined
Mother!,Client,neutral,undefined
Those are the monsters...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The things that won't stay dead.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And one night when you're too tired to kill the thing again,",Client,depression,undefined
"you let it kill you, just...",Client,depression,undefined
Just so that it will at least be,Client,depression,undefined
over.,Client,depression,undefined
Is that what you think happened to your Alex up there in his plane?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"That instead of fighting his guilt one more time,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"he just gave into it,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so it would be over?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
It's hard to know how much fight a person has in him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
True.,Client,depression,undefined
"You, for instance.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You don't have to worry about me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm glad.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But I wonder why you think you don't have the strength left aren't strong enough,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"to fight your mother one more time. I mean, maybe this time you'd win.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What are you suggesting?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm suggesting that maybe you could finally lay them to rest.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
One of them... my dad... is still alive.,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course I know that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But still,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"if you had clarity about what happened back then,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
maybe that could all rest in peace.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
And so could you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
How does that sound?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
As a goal for therapy?,Client,neutral,undefined
"As a goal,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
therapy or not.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't think I can do it without therapy.,Client,depression,undefined
I know it. I won't do the work. I won't think about it.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'll just go on blaming myself, taking it out on everybody else.",Client,depression,undefined
"I'll start smoking again, drinking too much.",Client,depression,undefined
I didn't know that drinking was a problem for you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's...,Client,neutral,undefined
"As long as I don't drink alone, it isn't.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why am I so resistant to you?,Client,anger,undefined
"Why do I come all the way down here,",Client,anger,undefined
only to tell you that I don't want to be in therapy?,Client,anger,undefined
Clearly I have to be in therapy.,Client,anger,undefined
I have to figure out how this next part of my life goes.,Client,anger,undefined
I have to know if I'm doing the right job.,Client,anger,undefined
"I have to know if I'm helping people. And if I'm not,",Client,anger,undefined
I have to know what I'm going to do next.,Client,anger,undefined
Did you really worry that I couldn't hear about Tammy,Therapist,neutral,Open question
because she was my patient?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of course I did. I do!,Client,anger,undefined
I appreciate that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And?,Client,anger,undefined
"So I thought about whether I could treat you both,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
especially if anything were to happen between the two of you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Do you think something is likely to could happen between the two of us?,Client,neutral,undefined
Not necessarily. But I have to aknowledge that something,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
could happen.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, I don't want anything like that.",Client,disgust,undefined
Are you sure?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Absolutely.,Client,disgust,undefined
As sure as you were that you didn't want to see me for therapy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Who doesn't want to be back in bed with his high-school sweetheart,",Client,anger,undefined
the girl who looks at him in the way he used to be?,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, don't you think about stuff like that?",Client,anger,undefined
"Let's try and stay on the topic, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Sure, sorry. I thought I was beginning to enjoy myself.",Client,disgust,undefined
"If I'm going to treat both you and Tammy, there's going to have to be some rules.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Like?,Client,neutral,undefined
Well...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
If you were the therapist,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"and you had two patients who had a history,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
what rules would you want?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Okay, well,",Client,neutral,undefined
I would make it clear that I couldn't tell either of them,Client,neutral,undefined
anything that I had learned in session about the other.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Okay?,Client,neutral,undefined
And...,Client,neutral,undefined
They couldn't expect me to analyze,Client,neutral,undefined
the other one and they couldn't use me to...,Client,neutral,undefined
send messages back... back and forth.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
My seeing them would have to be a kind of open secret.,Client,neutral,undefined
"We'd all know about it, of course, but we'd...",Client,neutral,undefined
all put it away and just,Client,neutral,undefined
not use it.,Client,neutral,undefined
All?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Even you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You think you could do that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I think so, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I think so, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
"When Alex and Laura slept together,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
you kept your response to that out of their therapy?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"As I remember it, I threw the affair in her face and a cup of coffee in his,",Client,anger,undefined
"but that, that... that was different.",Client,anger,undefined
How was that different?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Their affair was about me.,Client,anger,undefined
Laura slept with Alex because I wouldn't sleep with her.,Client,anger,undefined
And he slept with her because I wouldn't give...,Client,anger,undefined
And he slept with her because she was gorgeous and he felt like...,Client,anger,undefined
"What were you gonna say,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
before you corrected yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He slept with her because you wouldn't...?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Because I wouldn't tell him not to fly again.,Client,anger,undefined
Because I wouldn't try to control his recklessness.,Client,anger,undefined
And he wanted to show me what kind of damage he could do.,Client,anger,undefined
But you didn't see that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I didn't.",Client,depression,undefined
I guess I was too involved so I didn't get the message.,Client,depression,undefined
He counted on me to control his self-destructive influences.,Client,depression,undefined
"Instead I lashed out at him, he lashed out at himself and...",Client,depression,undefined
And down he went.,Client,depression,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You can see why I need to remain neutral,Therapist,neutral,Open question
if something were to happen?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of course.,Client,depression,undefined
I need you to promise me that nothing's going to happen.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Sure.,Client,neutral,undefined
Nothing will happen with Tammy Kent,Client,neutral,undefined
until or unless,Client,neutral,undefined
we are no longer your patients.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I want you to know,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What you've said about Alex today stays with me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm not going to mention any of that in the deposition.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Okay then.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you want to proceed?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, I do.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Good,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm glad.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"So,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
let's begin.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Last week you mentioned your high-school sweetheart.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Yeah,",Client,neutral,undefined
Tammy Kent.,Client,neutral,undefined
Last week you called her,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Tammy Kent, also by her full name.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
That's what everybody called her.,Client,neutral,undefined
There was another Tammy in the neighborhood,Client,neutral,undefined
so we called this one Tammy Kent.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she lived down the hall?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They moved in when I was about 14.,Client,neutral,undefined
And that was about the time your father moved out?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, he moved out a little bit after that.",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, it should've been the worst time of my life",Client,depression,undefined
with my father gone and my mother beginning her...,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, to suffer her bouts of...",Client,depression,undefined
"Depression, but...",Client,depression,undefined
"I wasn't sad, you know? I was...",Client,neutral,undefined
I was excited.,Client,neutral,undefined
What was it that excited you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Tammy.,Client,neutral,undefined
She'd show up out of thin air when I was having the worst day,Client,neutral,undefined
"and, you know, we'd just start talking.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And everything bad about my house,",Client,neutral,undefined
it felt like a movie.,Client,neutral,undefined
It felt like a movie that I was watching but that I wasn't in.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And even if my mother was crying all day,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'd tell Tammy Kent and she'd say, Yeah, it's going to be okay.",Client,neutral,undefined
What would be okay?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know, she just made me feel that I could get through it and that...",Client,neutral,undefined
if I let my mother cry that that was okay too.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I...,Client,neutral,undefined
"had the hope that when I went back down the hall, things'd be all right.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Or if they weren't, at least,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, I could...",Client,neutral,undefined
deal with them.,Client,neutral,undefined
So she helped you take care of your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She was so young to be a grief counselor.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, she felt more like my... My girlfriend.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And the way I felt about it was if I had a girlfriend,",Client,neutral,undefined
"then I was, you know, I was okay.",Client,neutral,undefined
I wasn't the poor kid with the absent father and the pitiful mother...,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, I was that kid, yes, I was,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but I wasn't a complete failure. At least, I had a...",Client,neutral,undefined
I had a girlfriend.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you have a physical relationship with her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Back then no.,Client,neutral,undefined
We were... 14.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Different times, not like kids now.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, it was another three years before we had sex.",Client,neutral,undefined
"After all that stuff had happened and,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, I was over... Over everything.",Client,neutral,undefined
What was it that happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, after my father left.",Client,depression,undefined
After your father...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Left...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You and your mother for one of his patients?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Right.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then my mother went into this, like really...",Client,depression,undefined
Deep...,Client,depression,undefined
depression.,Client,depression,undefined
"I remember one Christmas Eve,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Tammy's mother invited us to come over to the house and,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, her husband had died that year, but you'd never know it.",Client,neutral,undefined
She was the strongest woman I think I've ever met in my life.,Client,neutral,undefined
Their house was always,Client,neutral,undefined
full of light and music.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She was determined to stay alive for her kids, that's for sure.",Client,neutral,undefined
Not like your mother?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, not like my mother,",Client,depression,undefined
who jumped into the abyss and pulled me down with her.,Client,depression,undefined
So... about Christmas?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Yeah, anyway, Christmas. Christmas Eve.",Client,neutral,undefined
Tammy... Tammy appears at the door.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She says, Come on, come on.",Client,neutral,undefined
"So, I said, Hang on for a minute. So I went into my...",Client,neutral,undefined
"into my mother's room to see, you know, did she want to come?",Client,neutral,undefined
"But she was asleep,",Client,neutral,undefined
I decided...,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd leave without her,Client,neutral,undefined
and we went over to Tammy's place.,Client,neutral,undefined
It was...,Client,neutral,undefined
It was just... amazing.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tammy's mother had baked this...,Client,neutral,undefined
glazed ham with the pineapples and cherries,Client,neutral,undefined
and there were christmas cookies and people were drinking punch,Client,neutral,undefined
and everybody was singing,Client,neutral,undefined
and it was just great.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So then afterwards, Tammy and I went to her room.",Client,neutral,undefined
And we were just...,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, talking and... talking...",Client,neutral,undefined
I think that was...,Client,joy,undefined
when I first fell in love with her. You know?,Client,joy,undefined
I thought she was...,Client,joy,undefined
I thought she was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen.,Client,joy,undefined
"Anyway, suddenly, I remembered my mother",Client,neutral,undefined
because I was afraid that she'd wake up,Client,neutral,undefined
and that she wouldn't know where I was.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So I ran out of Tammy's room, and...",Client,neutral,undefined
What happened when you got home?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't really remember.,Client,depression,undefined
"Finding my mother unconscious on the floor,",Client,depression,undefined
"calling the ambulance,",Client,depression,undefined
the trip to the hospital... I don't even remember any of it.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, from the time I left Tammy's bedroom",Client,depression,undefined
"until I got to the hospital corridor, it's all just, like...",Client,depression,undefined
It's all a blur. It's all missing.,Client,depression,undefined
It's like... it's erased.,Client,depression,undefined
It's very important that you try and remember that night.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I can't. I have tried.,Client,anger,undefined
My mother's first suicide attempt the most important night of...,Client,anger,undefined
"The most important night of my life,",Client,anger,undefined
but I don't remember anything.,Client,anger,undefined
Why was it the most important,Therapist,neutral,Open question
night of your life?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Because if I'd stayed with her,",Client,depression,undefined
"she wouldn't have tried to, you know, kill herself.",Client,depression,undefined
"I know it took years before she finally did it,",Client,depression,undefined
but that Christmas Eve,Client,depression,undefined
"when I wasn't there,",Client,depression,undefined
that was the first time she did it.,Client,depression,undefined
That's when it all started.,Client,depression,undefined
"Paul, you were a 14-year-old kid.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You had just had the most wonderful night of your life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, but...",Client,depression,undefined
it doesn't matter.,Client,depression,undefined
It does matter.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
She took your wonderful night away from you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She punished you for neglecting her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She showed you what damage she could do,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"if you ignored her, if you didn't take care of her.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it wasn't just the threat on her life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But a threat on my life as well, is that what you mean?",Client,depression,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I was totally fine. I mean,",Client,neutral,undefined
I was just standing there in the hall,Client,depression,undefined
with a stomachful of cookies.,Client,depression,undefined
"She was the one in the hospital with the tubes sticking out of her arms,",Client,depression,undefined
the nurses running in and out.,Client,depression,undefined
I was out enjoying myself.,Client,depression,undefined
She was about to die.,Client,sadness,undefined
What could you have done?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
All I know is I left her for one night and that was the night she did it.,Client,depression,undefined
So...,Client,depression,undefined
"whatever I was doing before that, obviously I was...",Client,depression,undefined
I was helping her.,Client,depression,undefined
It's very important that you remember exactly,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
what happened to you that night.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
maybe you'll discover something missing.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know, some detail",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that'll help you feel... less guilty.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I am guilty.,Client,disgust,undefined
I know for a fact that you couldn't save her.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Just like I know for a fact,Therapist,neutral,Approval
that you couldn't save Alex.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But my knowing those things is meaningless.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You have to know them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You do.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Okay.,Client,depression,undefined
So you have to do whatever it is you have to do,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
to remember that night.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Like what?,Client,depression,undefined
Like... hypnosis?,Client,depression,undefined
You'll figure it out.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'll see you next week.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Yeah, and...",Client,neutral,undefined
thanks.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're welcome.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Hi, could I have... A phone number for Tammy Kent?",Client,neutral,undefined
I mean... Meswick.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tammy Meswick.,Client,neutral,undefined
Connect me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hi, Tammy, it's Paul Weston.",Client,neutral,undefined
Could you give me a call at this number when you have a chance?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's nothing urgent.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just wanted to ask you something about...,Client,neutral,undefined
About my mother.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hey, Paul, it's 7:08 and I'm downstairs.",Client,neutral,undefined
"So if you're sleeping, wake up.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Mia, sorry.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I got detained.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Where were you? I'm freezing.,Client,anger,undefined
My apologies. Come on up.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You go back to Maryland on the weekends?,Client,anger,undefined
Sorry about that.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What happened? Amtrak broke down?,Client,anger,undefined
Are you upset that I kept you waiting?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm stood up even by the man that I pay.,Client,anger,undefined
"If you took the train, it must've left around",Client,anger,undefined
3:00 in the morning. That's unusual.,Client,anger,undefined
None of my business. I know.,Client,anger,undefined
"But, you know, this is our first real session.",Client,anger,undefined
And I'm already out,Client,anger,undefined
12 minutes.,Client,anger,undefined
We can add it on at the end if you like.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"No, I can't. I have a meeting with a new client,",Client,neutral,undefined
a plastic surgeon.,Client,neutral,undefined
Lucky you don't need lipo.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You go to one of my guys, you could end up dead",Client,neutral,undefined
with nice thighs.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'll remember that.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I worked all weekend,",Client,neutral,undefined
which was fine because this was the weekend,Client,neutral,undefined
that Bennett and I were supposed to go away together.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And, no, he didn't call saying he wants me back.",Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe this is a mistake.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, if I'm gonna be kept waiting at 7:00 a.m...",Client,anger,undefined
Do you feel like I wasn't...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
On time?,Client,anger,undefined
I hope it was worth it. Were you with your girlfriend?,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that what you imagine?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you deflect everything that's personal?,Client,anger,undefined
Never mind. I already know.,Client,anger,undefined
My being late seems to have brought up quite a few feelings...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So this is more of a home really than an office.,Client,anger,undefined
I think you said last week that you found it homey.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Homey,",Client,neutral,undefined
but cold. You must,Client,neutral,undefined
turn the heat down when you go away.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is this how your Maryland office looked?,Client,neutral,undefined
What happened to all of those patients?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, I know what happened to Alex,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but all the others. You told them their feelings were important,",Client,neutral,undefined
and then you just left them?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Is it possible that you're worried that I might leave again, Mia?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Winter equals hell for hair.,Client,neutral,undefined
What's going on?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't want to be here.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't like brownstones...,Client,disgust,undefined
Too much brown.,Client,disgust,undefined
And this has absolutely nothing to do with the last week's session.,Client,disgust,undefined
Because I had not even had a chance to think about that.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Actually, I have,",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
and...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I was thinking about what you said at the door just before you left.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"When I said, you owe me a child?",Client,anger,undefined
That was a joke.,Client,anger,undefined
Maybe it was.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I get the feeling that there might have been a little more to it than that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, no, there wasn't. It was just a comment.",Client,anger,undefined
"Sometimes a comment is just a comment, right?",Client,anger,undefined
How are you? Nice to see you. You owe me a child.,Client,anger,undefined
Aren't you glad I'm back?,Client,neutral,undefined
Who's Laura?,Client,neutral,undefined
Laura?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Who is she?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not sure who you're referring to.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's not a hard question.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm asking you about Laura Hill.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's an ex-patient of yours.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If she's a patient of mine, then you know I can't discuss her.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
But I can.,Client,neutral,undefined
Where is this coming from?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
An envelope was delivered to my office.,Client,neutral,undefined
Henry must've made a mistake and thought that I was still your lawyer.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I opened it. And it was her deposition,Client,neutral,undefined
regarding Alex's state of mind.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you read it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are you curious about what she said?,Client,neutral,undefined
I hope that you gave those papers to my lawyer.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"It's obvious she was in love with you,",Client,neutral,undefined
or is.,Client,neutral,undefined
How so?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's in and between her words.,Client,neutral,undefined
She might as well have,Client,neutral,undefined
sealed it with a kiss.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what does that mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You are curious.,Client,neutral,undefined
Well...,Client,neutral,undefined
She describes how she dumped her fiance five minutes before the wedding...,Client,neutral,undefined
That's a nice story... And how she slept with Alex.,Client,neutral,undefined
And that tells you that she was in love with me.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She did it to make you jealous. It doesn't take Freud to figure that out.,Client,neutral,undefined
She wanted to walk into her session,Client,neutral,undefined
and tell you that she was fucking a fucking war hero.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what else did she say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She said that you two became friends,Client,neutral,undefined
"after the therapy ended,",Client,neutral,undefined
that you called her on the phone.,Client,neutral,undefined
You broke the rules for her.,Client,neutral,undefined
How many other patients have you done that with?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Mia, whatever happened- Whatever you imagine happened...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think you had an affair with her.,Client,anger,undefined
You're not gonna respond?,Client,anger,undefined
I must've hit a nerve.,Client,anger,undefined
"So what, you broke her heart?",Client,anger,undefined
She broke yours.,Client,anger,undefined
"Oh, she does support your case, though.",Client,anger,undefined
"She says that you did not mistreat Alex,",Client,anger,undefined
she mistreated you by sleeping with him.,Client,anger,undefined
Come on.,Client,anger,undefined
"Let's look atyour actions here, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Oh, she says she wants you to know, though, you're in her thoughts.",Client,anger,undefined
You opened a legal document that was not meant for you.,Therapist,anger,Restatement
Point taken. I crossed a boundary.,Therapist,anger,Restatement
"More than that, you knowingly violated a basic tenet of your profession.",Therapist,anger,Restatement
That makes two of us.,Client,anger,undefined
And you brought it into session.,Therapist,anger,Restatement
"Paul, do you have any idea how many therapists are successfully sued",Client,anger,undefined
for sleeping with their patients?,Client,anger,undefined
"What are you trying to say, Mia?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
How could you?,Client,depression,undefined
Was she that young and pretty?,Client,depression,undefined
Or did she make you feel that big and important?,Client,depression,undefined
Take it. It's yours.,Client,anger,undefined
Do you want me to pick that up?,Therapist,anger,Open question
It's all yours.,Client,anger,undefined
"I've just made an ass of myself, haven't I?",Client,depression,undefined
I bet you're angry.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe I am.,Therapist,anger,Approval
"Mostly, I'm...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm surprised.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"No, you're furious.",Client,anger,undefined
I can see it all over your face. But...,Client,anger,undefined
you just can't express it because you're not supposed to.,Client,anger,undefined
You want me to go?,Client,anger,undefined
Why would you think that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know what? You can stop. Stop, 'cause I'm leaving.",Client,anger,undefined
It seems to me that you're pushing me so that you can end this treatment.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"No, I don't blame you. And it's no big deal.",Client,anger,undefined
"Actually, I think it's a very big deal. You were the one who waited for me",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"in the cold, although I was late.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You waited for me.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Is it possible that you're goading me because it's easier,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to feel angry with me than look at your own pain?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I saw this show on the TV The other night... BBC.,Client,neutral,undefined
I saw this show on the TV The other night... BBC.,Client,neutral,undefined
About men and their...,Client,neutral,undefined
specially-made sex dolls.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The men pick out the eyes, and the mouth and the body.",Client,neutral,undefined
And they buy them clothes.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then they put lipstick on them,Client,neutral,undefined
and take them out for picnics and bike rides.,Client,neutral,undefined
And they love their girls because,Client,neutral,undefined
they don't talk,Client,neutral,undefined
and they never get pregnant and they don't get mad.,Client,neutral,undefined
And they have three perfect holes,Client,neutral,undefined
that can be repaired.,Client,neutral,undefined
Young and pretty forever.,Client,neutral,undefined
What were you thinking while you were watching this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was thinking about a receptionist in my office,Client,neutral,undefined
named Stefanie who likes to wear a lot of pink.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was thinking about a receptionist in my office,Client,neutral,undefined
named Stefanie who likes to wear a lot of pink.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she's so cute and friendly.,Client,neutral,undefined
"All she does is shop online, but nobody wants to fire her because she's just",Client,neutral,undefined
"too adorable, you know? And...",Client,neutral,undefined
She recently announced that she's quitting,Client,neutral,undefined
because some idiot proposed.,Client,neutral,undefined
So now I have to go to her engagement party and her bridal shower,Client,disgust,undefined
and her bachelorette party and her wedding. And it's endless torture.,Client,disgust,undefined
Sounds like you've been there before.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Three younger sisters and,Client,disgust,undefined
dozens of colleagues.,Client,disgust,undefined
When men look at a woman like,Client,neutral,undefined
"Stefanie, they just see the whole package.",Client,neutral,undefined
And what would that be?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Easy and fun and, you know,",Client,neutral,undefined
wild in bed at night,Client,neutral,undefined
and muffins from scratch in the morning.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And what do they see when they look at you, do you think?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Blonde lawyer,",Client,neutral,undefined
"might be fun to fuck, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
But what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
But that's it.,Client,neutral,undefined
What I usually get...,Client,depression,undefined
What I usuallygot from men is sex.,Client,depression,undefined
What did you get from Laura?,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think that I chose her over you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, you had sex with her.",Client,depression,undefined
Would that make you jealous?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I did have feelings for you, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
"Even though it was 20 years ago, you must have noticed.",Client,depression,undefined
And it sure felt like you had feelings for me.,Client,depression,undefined
"It's such a cliche, isn't it... A young woman falls for her therapist?",Client,depression,undefined
But if you were gonna get involved with a patient...,Client,depression,undefined
You wonder why I didn't pick you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You didn't.,Client,depression,undefined
You picked her.,Client,depression,undefined
You and Laura fucking your brains out.,Client,anger,undefined
"What, on this couch?",Client,anger,undefined
That makes me sick.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't want to talk about it. Don't make me talk about it.,Client,anger,undefined
What would happen if we did keep talking about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I bet you wanted her from day one.,Client,depression,undefined
You were smitten.,Client,depression,undefined
How did you manage to walk her to the door?,Client,depression,undefined
You assume that I found her irresistible.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She knew how to get to you.,Client,depression,undefined
How?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Act helpless and girlish.,Client,depression,undefined
She probably had slim hips...,Client,depression,undefined
"Smelled like candy apples,",Client,depression,undefined
"wore pink or something. Obviously, I have no idea.",Client,depression,undefined
Go on.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What do you imagine?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She'd stare at you all googoo-eyed,",Client,depression,undefined
"impressed by your brilliant interpretations,",Client,depression,undefined
made you feel like the world's best shrink.,Client,depression,undefined
And then one day her fiance got mad and she fell apart,Client,depression,undefined
and sobbed.,Client,depression,undefined
"And you felt sorry for her,",Client,depression,undefined
so you sat next to her.,Client,depression,undefined
Go on.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
And you touched her...,Client,depression,undefined
"Her cheek, her tears.",Client,depression,undefined
And you realized how young and beautiful and vulnerable she was.,Client,depression,undefined
"And you thought, this is my moment.",Client,depression,undefined
And you kissed her and there was no turning back.,Client,depression,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You had to have her,",Client,depression,undefined
unwrap her.,Client,depression,undefined
Take her.,Client,depression,undefined
And you had to feel her perfect skin and her round ass,Client,depression,undefined
and her flat stomach.,Client,depression,undefined
It must've been amazing for you...,Client,depression,undefined
So forbidden.,Client,depression,undefined
And for her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She probably didn't feel a thing. She's made out of silicone.,Client,depression,undefined
"Right, the sex doll.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It wasn't about the sex for her.,Client,depression,undefined
It was about winning.,Client,depression,undefined
What did she win?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You.,Client,neutral,undefined
For those minutes you were hers.,Client,depression,undefined
Now do you want me to go?,Client,depression,undefined
I'd rather know what you think happened next.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe you held her,Client,depression,undefined
gently until she fell asleep.,Client,depression,undefined
And she would like that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's what would make her feel good?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's what she really wants?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yes.,Client,depression,undefined
It's good to feel that closeness.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Maybe that's what you want from me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You mean, to fall asleep while you hold me?",Client,depression,undefined
"To be comforted, contained.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That would never happen.,Client,depression,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, come on, Paul, just admit that I'm difficult.",Client,depression,undefined
I push men away.,Client,depression,undefined
Look at Bennett and Andre...,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, pick any letter in the alphabet. I've sent them packing.",Client,depression,undefined
I'm like a knife in your neck.,Client,depression,undefined
It feels good when it's gone.,Client,depression,undefined
Right?,Client,depression,undefined
So you think I'd be relieved if you left?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Sure.,Client,depression,undefined
I walk out that door... You feel relief.,Client,depression,undefined
You want to pretend it never happened.,Client,depression,undefined
"Actually, I already told you,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I did think about our last session,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and the ones from 20 years ago.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You know, it's okay, Paul. You don't have to fake it with me.",Client,neutral,undefined
You kicked me out of here 20 years ago and you never thought about me again.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
You know who that is?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That's you playing, isn't t it?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's beautififul.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You kept that all these years?,Client,joy,undefined
Chopin's raindrop prelude.,Client,joy,undefined
"God, I love this piece,",Client,joy,undefined
how the eighth notes sound like rain.,Client,joy,undefined
That's from m a recital.,Client,joy,undefined
"My teacher, Mr. Campbell, put that together.",Client,joy,undefined
"He said that I was the best, but not to tell the others.",Client,joy,undefined
So you two had a secret.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What age were you then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I must've been 10.,Client,joy,undefined
That turned out to be my farewell performance.,Client,joy,undefined
That's a shame.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You play really beautifully.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
A few weeks after that recital I was,Client,neutral,undefined
sent to live at my aunt's in new jersey.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't remember you telling me you were sent away when you were young.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It was only about six months.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But when I came back, the piano was gone",Client,neutral,undefined
and twin girls were there.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you rember anything else about the separation?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
My dad came to visit me every sunday.,Client,neutral,undefined
He'd bring my favorite candies.,Client,joy,undefined
I liked those colored dots,Client,joy,undefined
that were stuck to paper,Client,joy,undefined
and those bottles filled with that sugary liquid.,Client,joy,undefined
And he would show me pictures of the twins.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I would tell him that,Client,neutral,undefined
I missed them all and wanted to come home.,Client,neutral,undefined
But he didn't take you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Where was your mother?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know. I mean,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm sure she came, maybe at christmas.",Client,neutral,undefined
What about the rest of the time?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I went to school.,Client,joy,undefined
"It sure was different from Greenpoint, though.",Client,joy,undefined
"Gosh, it was so clean...",Client,joy,undefined
And modern. And all the textbooks were new.,Client,joy,undefined
"I didn't really like the kids, though. I thought they were boring.",Client,neutral,undefined
Sounds lonely.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Maybe that's why you gave me that casassette...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because I'd know how you felt when you were 10,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and your parents made you leave.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Maybe you thought if I listened to it back then,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I would change my mind, let you stay.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I was difficult even then.,Client,depression,undefined
You think you deserved it.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was impossible.,Client,depression,undefined
How so?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I fought with my mother all the time.,Client,depression,undefined
Over what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Everything.,Client,depression,undefined
You were a difficult 10-year-old who loved chopin.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I don't know why we're talking about this.,Client,depression,undefined
They didn't do anything wrong and I don't blame them.,Client,depression,undefined
Earlier in the session you said that you didn't blame me.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I crossed the line. I violated attorney-client privilege.,Client,neutral,undefined
You thought I was kicking you out.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, I bet you wanted to, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm wondering, Mia, if you were testing me today.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You reprimanded me for being late.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You violated my privacy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You even wanted me to pick up the deposition of the floor.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I was pretty angry.",Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe you were trying to see,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
if I could be pushed away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So you're saying that...,Client,anger,undefined
my parents were right and Bennett was right;,Client,anger,undefined
that I'm so fucked up that nobody wants to be with me,Client,anger,undefined
because I push everyoyone away,Client,anger,undefined
and I'm demanding and I'm needy and I'm angry and I'm weepy?,Client,anger,undefined
I'm the seven fucking dwarves.,Client,anger,undefined
"That's not what I'm saying, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"What I'm saying is that maybe you are angry,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but you also want me to be close to you;,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and that no matter how difficult you say you are,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that beneath the toughness you still want to be connected to me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you're also afraid.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're afraid that I'm going to leave you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'd better leave.,Client,neutral,undefined
They're early.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I have a meeting and I don't want to be late.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you don't want to keep the next one waiting.,Client,neutral,undefined
So then...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I'll see you next monday same time?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
You owe me,Client,neutral,undefined
the 12 minutes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, then I'll see you at...",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
06:48,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you have sex with Laura?,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, this is the second week in a row",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
we're having what's called a doorknob moment.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
What a are you talking about?,Client,neutral,undefined
"That's when right at the end of the session, a patient says something",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
important.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is that your answer? 'cause that's a yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is it?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, did you?",Client,neutral,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You might want to water the plant outside.,Client,neutral,undefined
I poureded my latte on it.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thanks for seeing me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was on my way to school to turn this in and...,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know why I did it, but I came here instead.",Client,neutral,undefined
This is...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The big project you mentioned?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Would you mind if I had a look at it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, go ahead if you're interested in shit.",Client,disgust,undefined
That's really cool.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's supposed to be a World Trade Center memorial...,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course.,Client,neutral,undefined
What do you mean of course?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because god forbid any architecture student,Client,disgust,undefined
in the country gets another assignment ever again.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm sorry. I'm an asshole.,Client,neutral,undefined
Don't listen to me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I think it's just...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I think it's beautiful.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's really...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Exquisitely done.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Very beautiful.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm so tired.,Client,neutral,undefined
You haven't been sleeping this week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, not at all.",Client,neutral,undefined
Between my anxiety and my lymphoma,Client,depression,undefined
there's just never a good time.,Client,depression,undefined
That was supposed to be a joke.,Client,neutral,undefined
Was it funny?,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't think so.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Neither do i.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can I just... Do you mind?,Client,neutral,undefined
I tried so hard to sleep last night.,Client,depression,undefined
"It was 2:00 a.m., I was out of ideas",Client,depression,undefined
"and my hands were shaking so badly, I was afraid I'd wreck the whole thing",Client,depression,undefined
"if I tried to keep working on it,",Client,depression,undefined
so I put it in the box.,Client,depression,undefined
"I changed my sheets, I...",Client,depression,undefined
"lit candles, put on music.",Client,depression,undefined
It sounds like I was trying to seduce myself.,Client,depression,undefined
So did you eventually fall asleep?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I couldn't.,Client,depression,undefined
My heart was racing and it felt like...,Client,depression,undefined
"I don't know. It felt like it wasn't blood running through my veins, it was something else...",Client,depression,undefined
"Fire, poison.",Client,depression,undefined
I just... I wanted to...,Client,depression,undefined
open myself up and get it all out somehow.,Client,depression,undefined
Slit my wrists or take off my own head.,Client,depression,undefined
I would never. Don't worry.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm just trying to describe how it felt.,Client,depression,undefined
It sounds like a terrible night.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I can't have another one like that.,Client,depression,undefined
I will lose my mind.,Client,depression,undefined
"When you said that the poison was running through your veins,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Can I tell you what I thought of immediately?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Chemo.,Client,depression,undefined
Cancer.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Same thing.,Client,depression,undefined
"No, it isn't.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You can choose not to have chemo.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Touché.,Client,neutral,undefined
I had this thought last night...,Client,depression,undefined
I just kept thinking it over and over.,Client,depression,undefined
It used to happen to me a lot when I was a kid.,Client,depression,undefined
"The summer before I went to high school, I got this song stuck in my head",Client,depression,undefined
and I couldn't get it out.,Client,depression,undefined
I really thought I was going insane.,Client,depression,undefined
What do you think it would feel like,Therapist,neutral,Open question
to go insane?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like falling...,Client,depression,undefined
Into nothing.,Client,depression,undefined
Can we not talk about losing my mind?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Would you like to tell me about the thought that you had last night,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
the one that you couldn't get out of your head?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I wanted to go home.,Client,depression,undefined
I really wished I could go home.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then I thought,",Client,depression,undefined
You can't go home.,Client,depression,undefined
Your home is so long ago,Client,depression,undefined
and so far away.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then I just kept thinking,",Client,depression,undefined
Your home is so long ago,Client,depression,undefined
and so far away.,Client,depression,undefined
Your home is so long ago and so far away.,Client,depression,undefined
And this home that you're...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"that you're thinking about, where is it?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Or was it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can I tell you in a moment?,Client,depression,undefined
I mean...,Client,depression,undefined
Can I just... I just need to close my eyes for a second.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm so tired.,Client,depression,undefined
What time is it?,Client,depression,undefined
08:00,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Really? Already?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
7:59 actually.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Perfect.,Client,neutral,undefined
Could you... Could you wake me,Client,neutral,undefined
"at 8:00, would you mind?",Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"April, wake up.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Wake up, April.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Wake up,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What time is it?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's 8:00.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Good.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's over.,Client,neutral,undefined
This project was due yesterday but my professor said,Client,anger,undefined
we had until 8:00 in the morning to turn it in.,Client,anger,undefined
It was hideous.,Client,depression,undefined
It looks better now.,Client,depression,undefined
Why do you say that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It didn't work at all.,Client,disgust,undefined
The dimensions were all off.,Client,disgust,undefined
I relied too much on negative space.,Client,disgust,undefined
It was just sitting there.,Client,disgust,undefined
I couldn't make it soar.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I have to tell you, it's...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
it's very hard to see you destroy your own work.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I did,Client,sadness,undefined
I did fall asleep last night. I just rembered a dream I had.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I was on top of the model, but it was life-size, and I fell.",Client,sadness,undefined
Do you ever get those?,Client,sadness,undefined
Falling dreams?,Client,sadness,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I get those all the time.,Client,sadness,undefined
And how do you feel when you wake up?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
"My heart is pounding, and I feel like...",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't even know how to describe it.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's a kind of joy.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So, different from falling into nothing?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
So falling is something that you're afraid of,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and yet you're attracted to it at the same time.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What does that mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
"When you're awake, you work so hard to keep everybody",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and everything under your control,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"so in your dreams,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"it makes sense that you find yourself finally falling,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"releasing everything, letting everything go,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because it's a kind of fantasy for you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why are you telling me that? Is that supposed to help me?,Client,disgust,undefined
It'll only help you if it rings true. If it doesn't...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But it's in my head now. You put it in my head.,Client,disgust,undefined
Now I have to think about it.,Client,disgust,undefined
Like that thought you had last night.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What?,Client,disgust,undefined
"You started thinking about something, you can't stop.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Your thoughts become obsessive.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Don't say that. You...,Client,anger,undefined
You have no idea what you're talking about.,Client,anger,undefined
Have you ever been on a subway car that breaks dow,Client,anger,undefined
and there's some guy...,Client,anger,undefined
some shy-looking kid who starts repeating something to himself,Client,anger,undefined
"over and over, like, 7:15, 59th and Lex.",Client,anger,undefined
"7:15, 59th and Lex, over and over, louder and louder",Client,anger,undefined
until just saying the words isn't enough,Client,anger,undefined
and he starts hitting himself and thrashing around,Client,anger,undefined
and finally has to be subdued and tranquilized?,Client,anger,undefined
That is what it means to have obsessive thoughts.,Client,anger,undefined
I just like thinking things through.,Client,anger,undefined
You're talking about your brother.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I've noticed that you're constantly trying to feel what he feels.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, he can't describe how he feels, so...",Client,anger,undefined
he needs someone to interpret it for him.,Client,anger,undefined
"Your empathy is... It's admirable, April.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
But it can be really draining,Therapist,neutral,Approval
trying to feel everyone else's feelings as well as your own.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Maybe...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
instead of your own.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't... I'm sorry for losing my temper.,Client,neutral,undefined
You don't have to apologize to me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I did fall out of a building once.,Client,neutral,undefined
When?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We were on vacation in Miami.,Client,depression,undefined
I was only 10.,Client,depression,undefined
My mother is obsessed with Cuba...,Client,depression,undefined
"Cuban music, Cuban food, Cuban culture.",Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, we were down there without my brother.",Client,depression,undefined
We left him...,Client,depression,undefined
"For the first time ever, I think...",Client,depression,undefined
"with my grandparents, just me and my folks.",Client,depression,undefined
I remember this one night there was a band,Client,neutral,undefined
playing Cuban music down below,Client,neutral,undefined
and my parents started to dance,Client,neutral,undefined
right there in the hotel room.,Client,neutral,undefined
I went over to the window,Client,neutral,undefined
so that I could watch them dance,Client,neutral,undefined
and feel the...,Client,neutral,undefined
The breeze from the ocean on my back at the same time.,Client,neutral,undefined
Somehow...,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't even know how it happened...,Client,neutral,undefined
I fell out the window.,Client,neutral,undefined
I must've just leaned back and fallen.,Client,neutral,undefined
I landed on the...,Client,neutral,undefined
What's the word? The awning,Client,neutral,undefined
"one floor below. I mean, I was fine.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I just laid there for a second, I looked up at the window",Client,neutral,undefined
and then I slid off and landed on the sidewalk.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you remember feeling frightened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I remember,Client,neutral,undefined
as soon as my feet hit the sidewalk I started to bawl.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then I walked back into the hotel and I rode the elevator up.,Client,neutral,undefined
I looked in the mirror,Client,neutral,undefined
and I made myself stop crying.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So you could stop crying, just like that?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I just looked at myself and I said, April",Client,neutral,undefined
"you have to stop,",Client,neutral,undefined
and I did.,Client,neutral,undefined
I can still do that.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When I walked back into the room, my mother...",Client,depression,undefined
Had her head on my dad's shoulder.,Client,depression,undefined
They were still dancing.,Client,depression,undefined
They hadn't noticed you were gone?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
No.,Client,depression,undefined
Why did you have to stop crying?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What?,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, You were 10 years of age,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you had fallen out the window. Why couldn't you cry to your mother?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She was so happy.,Client,depression,undefined
"The way she held my father in that room,",Client,depression,undefined
"the way they swayed,",Client,depression,undefined
my mother closed her eyes as they swayed.,Client,depression,undefined
My mother never closes her eyes.,Client,depression,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She can't take them off Daniel.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not an empathetic person. I'm really not.,Client,depression,undefined
You asked me,Client,depression,undefined
where home was for me.,Client,depression,undefined
"It was there,",Client,depression,undefined
in Miami.,Client,depression,undefined
That's the place I want to go back to...,Client,depression,undefined
that room with my parents.,Client,depression,undefined
Without Daniel.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Right.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you ever read that book On the beach?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's about the nuclear holocaust,Client,neutral,undefined
and these people are waiting for the radiation,Client,neutral,undefined
"to reach Australia, but they're happy.",Client,neutral,undefined
They fall in love.,Client,neutral,undefined
They buy benches for their gardens.,Client,neutral,undefined
They don't think about the future.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was reading that while we were down there.,Client,neutral,undefined
You were reading that book at age 10?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I used to be precocious.,Client,neutral,undefined
And that's what I had hoped would happen...,Client,neutral,undefined
"a nuclear war would destroy everything else in the world,",Client,neutral,undefined
and we could just stay on the beach.,Client,neutral,undefined
We couldn't stay.,Client,depression,undefined
We had to get back.,Client,depression,undefined
"Daniel had stopped eating, gone back to hitting himself.",Client,depression,undefined
My grandparents called in a panic.,Client,depression,undefined
My mother went to the airport and got the next flight home.,Client,depression,undefined
My dad and I drove back that night.,Client,depression,undefined
Daniel wouldn't even look at us.,Client,depression,undefined
He couldn't speak.,Client,depression,undefined
It was like we had set him back three years.,Client,depression,undefined
My mother never forgave herself for that trip.,Client,depression,undefined
You are an empathic person...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"the way you talk about your brother, the compassion you feel for him.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But you can be an empathic person and still feel contradictory emotions,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"still feel anger, still feel...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
jealousy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why would I be jealous of Daniel?,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe because your mother never closes her eyes to him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Daniel was allowed to show your parents how he was feeling.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"When he got upset, hurt or scared, they knew it,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
whereas you had to be perfect. You fell out a window,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and your mother had no idea.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You can't blame her for that.,Client,anger,undefined
"Jesus, don't talk about her like that.",Client,anger,undefined
How am I talking about her?,Client,anger,undefined
As if she was a bad mother.,Client,anger,undefined
She's a great mother.,Client,anger,undefined
"She gave me my confidence, told me how smart I was.",Client,anger,undefined
She made me feel like I could do anything.,Client,anger,undefined
"But Maybe as a child, you took that to mean that you shouldn't depend on her,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you should take care of it all on your own.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm not going to do this.,Client,anger,undefined
What are you not going to do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Slam my mother.,Client,anger,undefined
"She may not have been perfect, but she did her best.",Client,anger,undefined
She could have been a professional ballerina.,Client,anger,undefined
"She trained at Juilliard, but she gave all of that up",Client,anger,undefined
so that Daniel could have some semblance of a normal life...,Client,anger,undefined
I understand that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
... that he could,Client,anger,undefined
not feel like such a freak.,Client,anger,undefined
So don't sit there and tell me she made all these mistakes.,Client,anger,undefined
She didn't have a choice.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm not attacking your mother.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm just trying to understand why you can't tell her that you're sick.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, how much more can she take?",Client,anger,undefined
It's not your fault that she had to deal with Daniel.,Client,anger,undefined
Lately Daniel has been doing so much better.,Client,anger,undefined
She finally has some time on her hands.,Client,anger,undefined
"He's living in this group situation,",Client,anger,undefined
"he's got a job at the library stacking books,",Client,anger,undefined
and she has started to teach a dance class for little kids.,Client,anger,undefined
I went to meet her there.,Client,anger,undefined
She is having such a great time. I am not gonna take that away from her.,Client,anger,undefined
You think being sick will do that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She would stop teaching the class.,Client,anger,undefined
She'd think she has to drop everything to take care of me.,Client,anger,undefined
Maybe that's okay if she does. She should stop teaching for a while,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
to help take care of you for a little bit.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
She is finally getting the chance to live a little.,Client,anger,undefined
"I respect your wanting to protect your mother,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
but I think at a deeper level you're also trying to protect,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
yourself,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"from seeing your mother's fear for you, from feeling how much danger you're in.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You say that you want to protect her,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"but surely you know that if you were to die, if you were to die,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
she would never... and I know this. I can tell you this as a father...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"if that happened to me, I would never ever recover.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Listen to me. You have to begin chemo immediately.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
The reason you haven't is because you're scared to go through it alone.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is there anyone you can imagine yourself telling?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Anyone who you would want to be there with you?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I can't.,Client,anger,undefined
You can.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's too horrible.,Client,anger,undefined
What am I supposed to say? How am I supposed to tell her,Client,anger,undefined
that her daughter...,Client,anger,undefined
You mean you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That I have cancer?,Client,anger,undefined
"No, I can't. It's too horrible.",Client,anger,undefined
"Horrible as it is,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
not telling her is more horrible.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"When you say it, it makes sense...",Client,anger,undefined
just pick up the phone and tell her.,Client,anger,undefined
"But I know that once I leave here, I won't be able to.",Client,anger,undefined
Call her from here then.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Now?,Client,neutral,undefined
Go ahead.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
She'll just be leaving for work.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can I use your phone again?,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I presume you want the room again?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
How'd it go?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She was in the car.,Client,neutral,undefined
She wanted to call me back...,Client,neutral,undefined
It's illegal to talk and drive at the same time.,Client,neutral,undefined
"With my dad in the army, she follows the law.",Client,neutral,undefined
You can stay here for 10 minutes and call her back.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"No, I'm so tired.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm gonna take a nap and call her when I get up.,Client,neutral,undefined
Will you call me after you've spoken to her?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Do you need a moment, Walter?",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm not gone three days and all hell breaks loose.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, if it's an emergency, we can...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
We can reschedule.,Client,neutral,undefined
We've already rescheduled.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was supposed to be here at 6:00.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's 8:00. No, it's after 8:00.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm really sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I appreciate you're seeing me later.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know you must have a life outside of here.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, it's fine. I had an hour free.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
If you understood... if you really understood how loath I am to be late.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm really sorry. This isn't me at all.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Really, it's fine.",Client,disgust,undefined
Here.,Client,disgust,undefined
What's this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's for your time.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're paying for the session in cash?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, it's not for the session.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'll write a check for that. This is... This is just something extra for you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"That's really not necessary, Walter. Thank you.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Someone...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Unimpeachable, huh? I like that.",Client,neutral,undefined
What do you mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I wasn't trying to bribe you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, I'm... That's not the way I operate.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Although, I tell you, sometimes it might be easier for me if I did.",Client,neutral,undefined
I understand.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You were just trying to make up for lost hours.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I understand.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Exactly.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know you value your time and I've wasted some of it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It was generous of you to offer. Thank you, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

"Marie, I said no calls, for Christ's sake! Can't...",Client,anger,undefined
Are you sure?,Client,anger,undefined
That son of a bitch.,Client,anger,undefined
"No, don't let him know that you've reached me.",Client,anger,undefined
Just let him think I'm walking into it.,Client,anger,undefined
I'll call you from the car.,Client,anger,undefined
Just give me a half hour of peace.,Client,anger,undefined
Can you do that?,Client,anger,undefined
Unbelievable.,Client,anger,undefined
This little pisser... Jace!,Client,anger,undefined
He's not even half my age,Client,anger,undefined
and somehow he thinks he's gonna use this to bring me down.,Client,anger,undefined
He's so self-deluded he actually thinks they're gonna give him my job.,Client,anger,undefined
"Walter, you seem...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's my own fault.,Client,anger,undefined
"In a way. I mean,",Client,anger,undefined
"he was very bright, eager,",Client,anger,undefined
good schools. I brought him into the company.,Client,anger,undefined
But he's green. He's in over his head. It's...,Client,anger,undefined

You seems like...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
you seem like you're in the midst of a breaking crisis here.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"No, Paul, it's not breaking.",Client,anger,undefined
It's already broke.,Client,anger,undefined
We cull ingredients from all over the world:,Client,anger,undefined
"China,",Client,anger,undefined
"Brazil, Indonesia.",Client,anger,undefined
Somehow something got into the pipeline.,Client,anger,undefined
"Walter, whatever is going on...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
it could be contaminated milk powder,Client,anger,undefined
or bacteria from one of the factories.,Client,anger,undefined
It could be a cheap lubricant leeching into the machinery...,Client,anger,undefined
You don't seem like you're able to get away from this right now.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I think that it would be a very good idea for us to reschedule.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Reschedule?!,Client,anger,undefined
When?,Client,anger,undefined
It's not gonna get any better tomorrow or the day after.,Client,anger,undefined

it might be another month before I get a chance.,Client,disgust,undefined

Both of them.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can I get a glass of water?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I hate this stuff.,Client,neutral,undefined
Connie's always telling me I should drink more of it.,Client,neutral,undefined

I spent the last 44 out of 72 hours,Client,neutral,undefined
in an airplane.,Client,neutral,undefined
And,Client,neutral,undefined
the hours waiting for the six flights were no barrel of laughs either.,Client,neutral,undefined
So the trip was in response to the...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
To the crisis.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, you were just saying how you have suppliers all over the world,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement

trying to track down the source of the problem.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I wasn't flying for the company.,Client,neutral,undefined
You weren't?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, I flew to Rwanda to get Natalie.",Client,anger,undefined
Did something happen to her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, she didn't say so.",Client,neutral,undefined
But I knew that she was in trouble.,Client,neutral,undefined
So,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
she didn't ask you to come?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"She didn't have to. Look, Paul, she's... she's my daughter.",Client,disgust,undefined
"She didn't have to. Look, Paul, she's... she's my daughter.",Client,disgust,undefined
"And until she went to Rwanda,",Client,disgust,undefined
I had spoken with her every day of her life.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Wherever I was in the world,",Client,disgust,undefined
I'd call her at bedtime and tell her I loved her.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Before she could talk,",Client,neutral,undefined
I made these little clicking noises.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Then after she went to Rwanda, we emailed every day.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Suddenly,",Client,disgust,undefined
"Suddenly a week ago, she",Client,disgust,undefined
writes her mother but not me.,Client,disgust,undefined
Connie doesn't do email,Client,disgust,undefined
so I had to print the letters out for her.,Client,disgust,undefined
And,Client,disgust,undefined
"she was asking Connie if I was all right,",Client,disgust,undefined
if,Client,disgust,undefined
the company was really complicit in this baby formula mess.,Client,disgust,undefined
It was crazy talk.,Client,disgust,undefined
Mightn't she have just been concerned for your welfare?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

"with your company in crisis,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you would chose to visit your daughter in Rwanda.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"The emails,",Client,anger,undefined
her voice wasn't her voice.,Client,anger,undefined
She would never doubt her father.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Now I'm not saying she's being brainwashed,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I knew she was hiding something,Client,neutral,undefined
and once I got there I found out I was right.,Client,neutral,undefined
What was she hiding?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"To start with,",Client,anger,undefined
she cut all her hair off.,Client,anger,undefined
"She'd always had this long auburn hair,",Client,anger,undefined
like my mother's when she was that age.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, that's gone now.",Client,anger,undefined
Don't you think that's disturbing?,Client,anger,undefined
"I can see why you might find it so, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But cutting hair, dyeing it weird colors,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"lopping it off even, I mean, that's what",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
what daughters do.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What else was different about her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What was the same about her?,Client,anger,undefined
I didn't know who I was talking to.,Client,anger,undefined
She had no shoes.,Client,anger,undefined
"She had given them away, it turns out.",Client,anger,undefined
She was so thin.,Client,disgust,undefined
She had this child in her arms...,Client,disgust,undefined
a little girl hanging in her arms like a sack of potatoes.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Are you okay, Walter?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"This is where she's living, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
This is where my daughter has chosen to live... some hellhole near Goma.,Client,disgust,undefined
"When she saw you, how did she react?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I don't think I spoke right away. I just stood there,Client,disgust,undefined
looking at her.,Client,disgust,undefined
Finally she got scared.,Client,disgust,undefined
"She said, What is it? Mom? Is mom all right?",Client,disgust,undefined
"And I said, Your mother's fine. She said, What are you doing here?",Client,disgust,undefined
"And I said, I've come to take you home.",Client,disgust,undefined
Get your stuff.,Client,disgust,undefined
And that didn't go down well?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No. At first she was...,Client,disgust,undefined
distant.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Dad, I can't leave right now. I have to finish a procedure.",Client,disgust,undefined
As if she'd got some medical degree in the last month.,Client,disgust,undefined
She said she'd meet me for dinner in a few hours in the big tent.,Client,anger,undefined
Then she pointed in the direction of some little shacks,Client,anger,undefined
in case I wanted to lie down.,Client,anger,undefined
She was living in one of those shacks.,Client,anger,undefined
They looked like outhouses and she was sleeping there.,Client,anger,undefined
I can see how upsetting that...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
that might have been for you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I mean, you spent your life...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
providing a good home for her and...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
this is how she chooses to live.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
So what happened at the dinner?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I didn't wait for dinner.",Client,neutral,undefined
I went back into the shack and I took all her stuff and...,Client,neutral,undefined
I put it in the jeep.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just...,Client,neutral,undefined
I just wanted to take it back,Client,neutral,undefined
with me to Kigali and at least,Client,neutral,undefined
have her clothes cleaned.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wanted to go back to the hotel that night and...,Client,neutral,undefined
take her to dinner and maybe talk some sense into her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The next thing I know, she's...",Client,anger,undefined
"tearing across this field, screaming at me",Client,anger,undefined
insane stuff...,Client,anger,undefined
"How I'm trying to control her,",Client,anger,undefined
"how I don't respect her,",Client,anger,undefined
how she's worked so hard to build up trust with these people and now...,Client,anger,undefined
they're gonna think that she's some neocolonialist,Client,anger,undefined
like me.,Client,anger,undefined
And there was something about Connie I'm not even going to repeat.,Client,anger,undefined
"I swear to god, Paul, it took everything I had not to slap her.",Client,anger,undefined
"Instead I just said, Don't you ever speak about your mother like that.",Client,anger,undefined
Then...,Client,depression,undefined
she broke down and started to cry.,Client,depression,undefined
What did you do then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I put my arms around her.,Client,depression,undefined
"I said, Natalie, we're going home.",Client,depression,undefined
And then...,Client,depression,undefined
she told me to go fuck myself.,Client,depression,undefined
She'd never said anything like that to you before?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She broke my heart, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
She broke my heart.,Client,depression,undefined
Why do you think she was so angry with you?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
She made that pretty clear.,Client,depression,undefined
I got an email from her when I got back to the hotel.,Client,depression,undefined
"It turns out that I'm domineering,",Client,anger,undefined
"obsessive,",Client,anger,undefined
"that I'm the cause of all her anxieties,",Client,anger,undefined
"that it's impossible to thrive or grow around me, and...",Client,anger,undefined
that's why she had to go away and now I'm...,Client,anger,undefined
ruining her only chance to free herself from me.,Client,anger,undefined
Now you see why I went over there?,Client,anger,undefined
I sensed this was coming from earlier emails.,Client,anger,undefined
"You know, hearing that email makes me...",Client,anger,undefined
Can we talk about the way you... came in here today?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Completely in charge on both phones,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
handing me your bag...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Not quite like I was a bellhop, but...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
something like that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm sorry if I offended you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, you didn't offend me. But...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it did catch my attention.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Walter, we both know that...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you are...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
an excellent... manager.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
World class.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Right?,Client,neutral,undefined
But in other roles where...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"you're not entirely in control,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"like say being a patient here, or...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
maybe when you went to see Natalie.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's much less comfortable for you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But what are you saying? I never try to control Natalie.,Client,neutral,undefined
I gave her whatever she wanted.,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You've given her everything.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And that's...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's something that's hard for other parents to do but...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
not for you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think it's possible that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
what's hard for you is...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
just... letting her be?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Letting her go?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did you think that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you felt her pulling away from you in those emails?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And then when you saw her at the camp did you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
did you get frightened?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Scared... of losing her so that you felt you had to tell her,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to pack up her things and come home?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Can't a father worry about his own daughter?,Client,anger,undefined
Of course he can.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But just look at...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
how you responded for a moment.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"In the midst of a major work crisis, you read an email",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"that she wrote to Connie and without stopping to think, you get on a plane",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and you fly halfway around the world.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's all right.,Client,anger,undefined
These work pretty quick.,Client,anger,undefined
"Xanax, it's...",Client,anger,undefined
Dr. Wells gave me the prescription.,Client,anger,undefined
Thank God he did.,Client,anger,undefined
Otherwise I'd never have been able to...,Client,anger,undefined
get out of that place.,Client,anger,undefined
Did you take a pill...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
after you saw Natalie?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Later.,Client,depression,undefined
I woke up in the middle of the night,Client,depression,undefined
in a cold sweat.,Client,depression,undefined
I had a nightmare...,Client,depression,undefined
that Natalie was gone.,Client,depression,undefined
Then I looked around me and with the...,Client,depression,undefined
"jetlag and the fatigue,",Client,depression,undefined
I had no idea where I was for a minute.,Client,depression,undefined
"I thought I was... back in my parents' house,",Client,depression,undefined
"in Tommy's room,",Client,depression,undefined
with all his sports trophies and awards.,Client,depression,undefined
I just couldn't stay in that room another second.,Client,depression,undefined
I had to get out of there. I was having trouble breathing.,Client,depression,undefined
And then I remembered the pills.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think it's strange that you were...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
that you were thinking about...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Tommy over there...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
in Africa?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
He's been on my mind lately.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you know when that started?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Has it been since Natalie left?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You said that you woke up and you felt that you had to get out.,Client,neutral,undefined
Hotels can be disorienting.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But losing Tommy was...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"very painful for you, wasn't it?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
My folks had the pain.,Client,depression,undefined
My folks had the pain.,Client,depression,undefined
"With all due respect, when parents lose a child it kills them.",Client,depression,undefined
It's really admirable that you remained so close to your parents,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
after that happened.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Like with the Donaldsons,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
as you've said.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"After their son James died,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you became like a son to them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"The good son,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the one everybody can depend on.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And then you had this dream. And...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you feel that you're suffocating in...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in Tommy's room.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What does this have to do with Natalie?,Client,anger,undefined
Maybe Natalie is trying to do something,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you've never allowed yourself to do:,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to separate from her parents.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
For you to stay connected means to never...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
stray.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Now Natalie is trying to do something in between, but you feel",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that she's abandoning you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the way Tommy did.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

I know.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But maybe that night in the hotel, Natalie's separation",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
from you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"felt,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

it felt like a death.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
God forbid.,Client,disgust,undefined

There's no comparison.,Client,disgust,undefined
There's a big difference.,Client,disgust,undefined
"When a child dies, he's gone.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Isn't that exactly the nightmare that woke you up, that Natalie was gone?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It wasn't the same.,Client,depression,undefined
I was trying to find her.,Client,depression,undefined
"I knew that no matter how bad I felt,",Client,depression,undefined
I had to put myself aside and think only of Natalie.,Client,depression,undefined
I took the pills.,Client,depression,undefined
And somehow it passed. And...,Client,depression,undefined
I dragged myself back to the hotel lobby,Client,depression,undefined
and I went online in the business center.,Client,depression,undefined
That's when I read her emails and I realized...,Client,depression,undefined
I realized...,Client,depression,undefined
"You realized what, Walter? It's okay to have the...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
thought here. You can say whatever you like.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I realized that she didn't need me at all.,Client,anger,undefined
Or maybe that's just what she needs to feel right now.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She's done with her old man.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm a booster rocket.,Client,anger,undefined
"She's launched, like your boys, isn't that what you said at our first session?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Did I? I'm sure I also said that Natalie was different.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd have to agree with you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You did raise her with the freedom to think for herself,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"to question authority figures, to confront the world of adults.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You gave her an incredible gift. Now she wants to use it.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
By telling me to go fuck myself?,Client,anger,undefined
That's what you heard.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"But before that, she wanted you to talk things over with her.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"She invited you to dinner, no?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She was just shining me on.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Possibly. Or possibly she really,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
wanted to talk to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you felt like she was disrespecting you and you reacted to that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know, I think that...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for her whole life she's been very aware of you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and how you feel and what you think and what she can do to make you happy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe part of the reason she's so angry is because,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
maybe for the first time in her life she knows that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
what she wants... is not what you want.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And she's having a very hard time reconciling herself to that fact.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She's having a hard time?,Client,anger,undefined
What about me?,Client,anger,undefined
So how did you leave things with her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I didn't.,Client,anger,undefined

When was the last time you saw him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Does it matter when I saw him?,Client,anger,undefined
"I try to talk to him, but he's...",Client,anger,undefined
He's not there.,Client,anger,undefined
Or maybe he is and he's just choosing to...,Client,anger,undefined
To hide.,Client,anger,undefined
Remind me again where he lives.,Client,anger,undefined
He's been in the same nursing home for the last 2 years.,Client,anger,undefined
"It's called Valley Haven, but it's not in a valley and it's not a haven.",Client,anger,undefined
It's filled with dead men walking,Client,anger,undefined

How did we get on to this? Jesus.,Client,anger,undefined
Are you surprised to find yourself talking about what a burden he is?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You know what I think? I think he mishandled his finances deliberately,Client,anger,undefined
so that I'd have to take care of him.,Client,anger,undefined
He threw himself at my mercy.,Client,anger,undefined
He's been sick for a long time.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why is he at the front of your mind today?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. I talked to my brother Patrick.,Client,neutral,undefined
He said my father seemed a little bit... off somehow.,Client,neutral,undefined
Like Patrick would know what that was.,Client,neutral,undefined
Your brother's visited him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"He goes over there and he eats his dinner, according to the nurses.",Client,neutral,undefined
Can't you tell them not to let him in at mealtimes?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't really care who eats his dinner.,Client,anger,undefined
I just...,Client,anger,undefined
What were you going to say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was going to say I'm just waiting for the man to die.,Client,anger,undefined
You asked.,Client,anger,undefined
It's very hard to have someone sick and dependent on you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It drains all your reservoirs.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It makes you very very tired.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I mean,",Client,anger,undefined
it's not like he was,Client,anger,undefined

Somebody could always eat his dinner for all he cared.,Client,anger,undefined
"He ate at the hospital, he said. My mother stopped",Client,anger,undefined
setting a place for him at the table when I was six years old.,Client,anger,undefined
Did she stop doing other things for him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I'm sure there were, but the man wasn't there.",Client,anger,undefined
You keep calling him the man.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Does that have any meaning for you?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"What, like...",Client,anger,undefined
Like he was supposed to be the man of the house,Client,anger,undefined
only I had to do that job for him?,Client,anger,undefined
Is that what it means?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I asked Tammy about him. You know what she said?,Client,neutral,undefined
You spoke to Tammy about your father?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"She said that the first time that she saw him,",Client,anger,undefined
she thought he looked just like the man was supposed to look.,Client,anger,undefined
So the man came from Tammy?,Client,anger,undefined
Her father died that year.,Client,anger,undefined
"I don't know, maybe she was fantasizing about my father.",Client,anger,undefined
"Actually, I'm sure she was.",Client,anger,undefined
She wanted to live in my apartment,Client,anger,undefined
and I wanted to live in hers.,Client,anger,undefined
"Anyway, Tammy and I,",Client,neutral,undefined
we...,Client,neutral,undefined

"A lot of it was what I remembered,",Client,neutral,undefined
"that my mother was at home, she was asleep,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I was at Tammy's, we ate the cookies, we were singing.",Client,neutral,undefined
And then Tammy and I went...,Client,neutral,undefined
"to her room to talk,",Client,neutral,undefined
but after a few minutes I jumped off the bed,Client,neutral,undefined
and ran down the hall to check on my mother.,Client,neutral,undefined
That was where your memory went blank. What about hers?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She says that I came right back and that I was really upset.,Client,neutral,undefined
"That my mother was sick and my father was with her,",Client,neutral,undefined
"waiting for an ambulance. By the time Tammy and I went back,",Client,neutral,undefined
"my father had already gone to the hospital with my mother,",Client,neutral,undefined
so Tammy's mother,Client,neutral,undefined
brought us to the hospital.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So, that night it turns out your father was actually with her.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That night he actually was the man.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I guess.,Client,neutral,undefined
You don't believe Tammy's version?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I believe it. Why would Tammy lie?",Client,neutral,undefined
It just doesn't add up.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Right, because if your father had already left home,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
how could he know that your mother was going to commit suicide?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
But...,Client,neutral,undefined
that was also kinda strange.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tammy said that he was always calling her mother to check on us.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, of course he was.",Client,anger,undefined
It must have been a fucking lot easier than coming over and seeing for himself.,Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, but he did come over that night.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"So, yeah, he called the ambulance, so what?",Client,anger,undefined
He happened to drop in one night when...,Client,anger,undefined
Maybe he came over to see his boys,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and his wife because it was Christmas eve.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What difference does it make if he was there one fucking night?,Client,anger,undefined
What about all the other nights?,Client,anger,undefined
"The nights when he was off with his girlfriend, when I was at home,",Client,anger,undefined
guarding my mother?,Client,anger,undefined
"All those other nights, where was your brother?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
He's older than you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

Baseball.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you ever see him play?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

"I don't know. Friends, I supposed",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you remember any of their names?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Where are you going with this?,Client,anger,undefined
I'm wondering if your brother was actually home.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Could you have air-brushed him out too?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You think that they were both there under the tree wrapping gifts?,Client,anger,undefined
Our memories can be very unreliable.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"We like to think of them as indelible records of our past,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

we fiddle with it a little bit before we put it back in.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"If we hate our husband now,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"we re-remember the wedding as less joyous,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"or we say, He was never the right one for me anyway.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
We're constantly altering our memories,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so the past won't conflict with the present.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"My memory is fucked. So what was my childhood really like, Gina?",Client,anger,undefined

some of the facts aren't what you think they are.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Gina, I'm familiar with the whole notion of a screen memory, yeah.",Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, of course you are. So then, you know your Christmas eve memory",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"tells us about that whole period of your childhood, not just one night.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were overwhelmed.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You felt that you were the only one who knew how much trouble she was in.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"My father knew, he just didn't give a shit.",Client,anger,undefined
Are you sure about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"If he cared, he would have put her in an institution.",Client,anger,undefined
"He'd have gotten her help,",Client,anger,undefined
which he finally had to do but not before I spent every day of high school,Client,anger,undefined
having no idea of what I was going to face when I came home.,Client,anger,undefined
"Would all the knives be sticking out of the wall,",Client,anger,undefined
the bathtub be overflowing?,Client,anger,undefined
Would she have an electrical cord around her neck?,Client,anger,undefined
Or would she suddenly decide to take it upon herself,Client,anger,undefined
to clean and paint the hall closets?,Client,anger,undefined
Why do you think he didn't institutionalize her sooner?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"I don't know, maybe he needed somebody to take care of the kids.",Client,anger,undefined
Or maybe he didn't want to take your mom away from you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Or you away from her.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"How about he and my brother ignored her,",Client,anger,undefined
until she finally had to try to kill herself to get them to come home?,Client,anger,undefined
"You know, Paul, one of the...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
confusing things about emotional injury in families,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"is that it can feel so unfair, it can feel so random.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's like an automobile accident:,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"everybody's in the car,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
but you're the only one who went through the windshield.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Well, actually it was my mother who went through the windshield.",Client,anger,undefined
"And you tried to grab her, but, Paul...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Could you look at me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You were in the backseat.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
All you could do was watch.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And my brother walks away without a scratch.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't know what he suffered.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"My father was in the driver's seat,",Client,anger,undefined
struggling to keep our little family from crashing.,Client,anger,undefined
Is that what you're saying?,Client,anger,undefined
"Yes, I suppose that's what he thought he was doing.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Is that what you're trying to do now,Therapist,neutral,Open question
with your family?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, coming down to see the kids every weekend,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
calling them every day?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He was nothing like me and I am nothing like him.,Client,anger,undefined
"Paul, you're working very hard",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to keep from taking in any good information about him.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Tell me why the hell I would do that?,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, if he was half-decent, I would like to know it.",Client,anger,undefined
He never did one fucking thing to help.,Client,anger,undefined
But Tammy just told you a good thing he did:,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
checking up on you from down the hall.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What does Tammy know? He was probably flirting with her anyway.,Client,anger,undefined
Your dad was flirting with Tammy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He's a fucking doctor. They're all flirts.,Client,anger,undefined
"The whole time I was growing up, he was always...",Client,anger,undefined
He was always what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You know...,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, it's just a memory of mine, excuse me, so it can't be trusted.",Client,anger,undefined
Are you afraid to say it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He was always...,Client,anger,undefined
With other women.,Client,anger,undefined
How do you know this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Okay, I'll tell you how I know. I was 10 years old.",Client,anger,undefined
My mother was yelling at him because he was...,Client,anger,undefined
screwing this nurse,Client,anger,undefined
and she wanted him to look at the effect that it was having on me,Client,anger,undefined
"so she pushed me at him, hard,",Client,anger,undefined
and I hit a table and I split my forehead wide open: he sewed me up.,Client,anger,undefined
So you're right. He wasn't completely useless.,Client,anger,undefined
Are you happy now?,Client,anger,undefined
"These fights about other women,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
they went on for a long time.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Oh, early and often.",Client,anger,undefined
I thought that the fights began after your father left her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"It seems that they were having trouble before he left her,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
before she got sick.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe his fucking around made her sick.,Client,anger,undefined
His fucking around made her sick?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's what I said. Christ!,Client,anger,undefined
You know what? No wonder my patients complain about this.,Client,anger,undefined
Would you stop repeating what I'm saying?,Client,anger,undefined
Just say something else.,Client,anger,undefined
"I know it's irritating, but I just want to make sure that I understand.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Fine.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
So,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you believe that your father's infidelity caused...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"drove my mother crazy, yes.",Client,anger,undefined
"When your mother was finally admitted,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
wasn't she diagnosed with bipolar disorder?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"In your experience, can bipolar disorder",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
be caused by the infidelity of a spouse?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, Gina, bipolar disorder is not caused",Client,anger,undefined
by events in a patient's life.,Client,anger,undefined
Events can make you feel,Client,anger,undefined
bipolar.,Client,anger,undefined
"No, I know that much.",Client,anger,undefined
That's how I felt last year when Kate was...,Client,anger,undefined
with her lover.,Client,anger,undefined
"But no, infidelity can't make you bipolar.",Client,anger,undefined
You either are bipolar or you're not.,Client,anger,undefined
But...,Client,depression,undefined
if your wife...,Client,depression,undefined
"was bipolar, it...",Client,depression,undefined
could make you want to have an affair.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yeah, it could.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Especially if you were a doctor,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and your wife's mental illness made you feel inadequate,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"helpless,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
incapable of helping the person that you were closest to.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And since he couldn't heal her, he left her for another woman.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And he left her with me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think I'm a therapist today because I feel guilty,Client,anger,undefined
about my inability to heal my mother?,Client,anger,undefined
"No, I don't.",Client,anger,undefined
Good.,Client,anger,undefined
I think you felt your mother's illness deeply.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And I think even as a child, you had an empathic response to suffering.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you were too young,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and so you went to school. You worked, you studied, you thought.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And now when people come to you, you can help them.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you're not a therapist because you think you failed your mother.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You were a boy, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were in the backseat.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You tried to grab her, but she was already gone.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So I have this patient Oliver.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's a kid who's trying to survive his parents' divorce.,Client,neutral,undefined
And it's taking everything I have,Client,neutral,undefined
not to invite him to come live with me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know what he needs and I want to give it to him.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's the same with April and her cancer.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just want to stop them all going through the windshield.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does Oliver remind you of you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, neither of us...",Client,depression,undefined
Neither of us knows how to be around our fathers.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, I have an idea,",Client,depression,undefined
but it's the same idea I've had since I was Oliver's age.,Client,depression,undefined
I think of my father and he's still screwing his girlfriend,Client,depression,undefined
and I'm still scared to death that my mother's going to die.,Client,depression,undefined
Only she's already dead.,Client,depression,undefined
And he's almost dead.,Client,depression,undefined
And I'm about to become the orphan I've always felt,Client,depression,undefined
I was for 40 years.,Client,depression,undefined
I know you're going to do well by Oliver.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
There's always hope.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe the boy that you really wanna be good to is yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Take me out to a ballgame.,Client,neutral,undefined
Something like that.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Maybe what I ought to do first is...,Client,depression,undefined
Be a good son to my father.,Client,depression,undefined
What would that entail?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I Don't know, just go see the man.",Client,depression,undefined
"See how off he really is, maybe.",Client,depression,undefined
Read him the sports page.,Client,depression,undefined
Why haven't you been to see him this time?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I'm busy... I'm seeing the kids and I've got patients.,Client,depression,undefined
Actually the truth is I don't want to go.,Client,depression,undefined
He stinks,Client,depression,undefined
and he looks like hell.,Client,depression,undefined
I'll probably look...,Client,depression,undefined
Look bad too when I'm about to die.,Client,depression,undefined
I wonder if my kids will come and see me when I'm where he is.,Client,depression,undefined
What if they feel about me the way I feel about him?,Client,depression,undefined
What do they feel about you?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I don't know. They're so mad it's hard to tell how they feel.,Client,depression,undefined
"They're mad at you, Paul?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's what they feel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And what if I'm just like him?,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, did they feel",Client,depression,undefined
that they had to compete with my patients for my attention?,Client,depression,undefined
Have I too left my young son home alone with his mother?,Client,depression,undefined
What do the kids understand about why you and Kate are divorcing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Kate and I set them down and said the divorce had nothing to do with them.,Client,depression,undefined
"It was about a sentence longer than what my mother said to me, which was,",Client,depression,undefined
your father's moving out.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm sure they don't understand it any more than I did.,Client,depression,undefined
"I think I have to talk to them,",Client,depression,undefined
"you know, really",Client,depression,undefined
talk to them.,Client,depression,undefined
And I should...,Client,depression,undefined
I should talk to my father too.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, just...",Client,depression,undefined
talk to him.,Client,depression,undefined
"So,",Client,neutral,undefined
I've got my homework to do.,Client,neutral,undefined
And next week we'll talk about Tammy.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
What do you mean talk about Tammy?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Goodbye, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"It was about a sentence longer than what my mother said to me, which was,",Client,depression,undefined
your father's moving out.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm sure they don't understand it any more than I did.,Client,depression,undefined
"I think I have to talk to them,",Client,depression,undefined
"you know, really",Client,depression,undefined
talk to them.,Client,depression,undefined
And I should...,Client,depression,undefined
I should talk to my father too.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, just...",Client,depression,undefined
talk to him.,Client,depression,undefined
"So,",Client,neutral,undefined
I've got my homework to do.,Client,neutral,undefined
And next week we'll talk about Tammy.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
What do you mean talk about Tammy?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Goodbye, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I'm late, I know.",Client,neutral,undefined
"We said 6:48 and now it's 6:58,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I just really had to stop and get some breakfast.,Client,neutral,undefined
Where do you think you're going?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I don't want to make a mess in here and I just... I really have to eat.,Client,neutral,undefined
It would really be fine in here.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I... I don't have sessions in here.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
It's not a session. It's coffee.,Client,neutral,undefined
I found this amazing bakery right in your neighborhood.,Client,neutral,undefined
The donuts are still hot.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Here, this one's for you.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, thank you.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"No? Okay, well, I know you drink coffee.",Client,neutral,undefined
No? Come on. I got it for both of us.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've got 2%.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've got skim. I've got half and half.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I've got real sugar, fake sugar... I've got organic fake sugar.",Client,neutral,undefined
What's wrong? Can't I have some breakfast?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, of course you can. I just wonder why you can't have it in the other room.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"All right. Well, you wonder and I'm gonna eat.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you have a napkin?,Client,neutral,undefined
I had the craziest weekend.,Client,neutral,undefined
Friday night I went out with the first years... the baby lawyers...,Client,neutral,undefined
to this club in Brooklyn called Warsaw.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's in my old neighborhood and very hipster.,Client,neutral,undefined
If you can believe that.,Client,neutral,undefined
There was this band playing called the glass cat playing this...,Client,neutral,undefined
"kind of avant-pop postmodern rock,",Client,neutral,undefined
which I didn't really like because I prefer melody.,Client,neutral,undefined
But the guitarist... these long limbs like a gazelle,Client,neutral,undefined
and he had these fingers and he could play.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Mia, you're speaking very quickly.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Then I had a few drinks... or more than a few.,Client,neutral,undefined
And when the glass cat broke,Client,neutral,undefined
I brought him a scotch and I held it right up to his mouth.,Client,joy,undefined
"And he grabbed it and sipped it and said, thanks, babe,",Client,joy,undefined
which I liked.,Client,joy,undefined
And why did you like that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because he was the babe.,Client,joy,undefined
He was in his 20s.,Client,joy,undefined
So...,Client,joy,undefined
I went home with him.,Client,joy,undefined
I carried one of his guitars like a groupie.,Client,joy,undefined
I had forgotten what it's like with a young guy.,Client,joy,undefined
"God, when he told me he wanted me, I knew that it was true,",Client,joy,undefined
unlike Bennett the fish.,Client,joy,undefined
So you preferred the cat to the fish.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Lawyers are the worst in bed because they always have to be on top, you know?",Client,joy,undefined
And Bennett's penis is the size of a pen cap.,Client,joy,undefined
"No, an almond... erect.",Client,joy,undefined
"And who wants to fuck a little nut, right?",Client,joy,undefined
"But guitar boy and I, we went at it all night.",Client,joy,undefined
"And he must watch a lot of porn or something,",Client,joy,undefined
because the sex was acrobatic.,Client,joy,undefined
And you want me to ask you about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's just that I haven't jumped around like that,Client,joy,undefined
since I took trampoline at the Greenpoint Y.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, is this... is this shocking you?",Client,joy,undefined
Is that your intention?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
We changed positions constantly.,Client,joy,undefined
I mean Thank goodness I go to the gym a lot. It was like the sex olympics,Client,joy,undefined
"with the pommel horse and the handstands,",Client,joy,undefined
"straddle splits, stuck landing.",Client,joy,undefined
"Well, that sounds like quite a performance.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Give me the right partner and my game comes up.,Client,neutral,undefined
"With Bennett, why bother?",Client,neutral,undefined
That's the second time you've mentioned Bennett since you came in.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Bennett can kiss my well-fucked ass.,Client,joy,undefined
This boy told jokes.,Client,joy,undefined
What do a guitar solo and premature ejaculation have in common?,Client,joy,undefined
You know it's coming,Client,joy,undefined
and there's nothing you can do about it.,Client,joy,undefined
"A little boy says to his mother, mom, I wanna be a musician when I grow up.",Client,joy,undefined
"And she says, oh, honey, you know you can't do both.",Client,joy,undefined
That's funny.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
His futon was on the floor.,Client,joy,undefined
"His room was filled with these beautiful guitars,",Client,joy,undefined
"but that night, I was his favorite.",Client,joy,undefined
"That's important to you, Mia, isn't it?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Being the favorite.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe that's why it was so important for you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I told dave about you.,Client,joy,undefined
The musician?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, the cop.",Client,joy,undefined
Who?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The musician was friday night. The cop was saturday night.,Client,joy,undefined
"Oh, I see.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"So saturday day, you know, no sleep,",Client,neutral,undefined
I had to go shopping for my niece who's turning 6 this week,Client,neutral,undefined
"and I love her. I do, but my sisters go ballistic",Client,neutral,undefined
with these birthday parties.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's like roller-coaster or petting zoos and clowns that eat fire.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's insane.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And if I miss one, I'm selfish aunt Mia.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Meanwhile on my birthday nobody even sends me a card,",Client,depression,undefined
except dad.,Client,depression,undefined
He remembers.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, saturday night I went to a local pub.",Client,neutral,undefined
I just had a few bad chardonnays.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was just sitting there and this guy Dave...,Client,neutral,undefined
"50s, sturdy...",Client,neutral,undefined
told me that it's not safe to be in a bar alone.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I said, well, then I shouldn't be talking to you.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And he said, oh, I'm a cop.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm the only one in here that it's safe to be with.,Client,neutral,undefined
So...,Client,neutral,undefined
we went to a motel in Queens.,Client,neutral,undefined
Just over the bridge.,Client,neutral,undefined
He started telling me what to do...,Client,neutral,undefined
And I was this little girl. He had this power over me,Client,neutral,undefined
and I had to do exactly what he said when he said.,Client,neutral,undefined
You've stopped.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Don't you want to know how I reacted to that?,Client,neutral,undefined
I liked it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Somebody else in charge, you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
"He told me to just lie still while he, you know, did it to me,",Client,neutral,undefined
and that if I didn't follow his every word...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Come on, Paul. I know you wannna know what would happen if he...",Client,neutral,undefined
Do I?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He'd spank me.,Client,neutral,undefined
He told me to get on all fours and that I'd been a naughty girl.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then he would smack me... a little harder every time.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you ever done that? I bet you'd like to.,Client,neutral,undefined
And it's even scarier with a gun.,Client,neutral,undefined
He pulled a gun on you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It was in the holster on the chair.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He didn't use it, but it upped the ante, I'm telling you.",Client,neutral,undefined
Beats the hell out of Bennett's blackberry.,Client,neutral,undefined
We're back to Bennett.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And a year of me telling him what to do and where to do it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, touch me here. Kiss me there.",Client,neutral,undefined
Over to the right and back to the left.,Client,neutral,undefined
So in one weekend you found two men who were better than Bennett.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, I was trying to fuck that man out of me forever.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh shit! Jesus! Spilled milk, that's perfect, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Mia, it's fine. Don't worry about it.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's fine. I can do it later.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe this is a good time for us to go into the other room.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
So you want me on the couch?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Fine, you don't want me in your kitchen;",Client,neutral,undefined
you don't want me on the couch;,Client,neutral,undefined
I'll sit here.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think we need to talk about what's going on today.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"No, I was hungry.",Client,neutral,undefined
You wanted to have breakfast together.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Don't flatter yourself. I'm tired of eating alone.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's not about you.,Client,neutral,undefined
What isn't?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The breakfast or the weekend?,Client,neutral,undefined
You really think I slept around because of you?,Client,anger,undefined
How would that work?,Client,anger,undefined
Don't be coy.,Client,anger,undefined
"You think that I'm still jealous of Laura, so I acted out?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I didn't say that, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But as your therapist, I am interested in your behavior.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Picking up two men sounds out of character,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and I'd be remiss if I didn't explore what triggered it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, it wasn't you.",Client,depression,undefined
It was Bennett.,Client,depression,undefined
He asked me to...,Client,depression,undefined
have lunch with him on friday at the bowery hotel.,Client,depression,undefined
And I thought he wanted to woo me back.,Client,depression,undefined
Wrong.,Client,depression,undefined
"After we'd eaten, he told me that...",Client,depression,undefined
he was gonna leave his wife for his girlfriend.,Client,depression,undefined
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, that was news to me.",Client,depression,undefined
"He had his wife, he had me and he had her.",Client,depression,undefined
And guess who it is.,Client,depression,undefined
"It's Stefanie, our office receptionist.",Client,depression,undefined
You mentioned Stefanie last week.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said you were dreading going to her bridal shower.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, we're past that, 'cause now that Stefanie's pregnant",Client,depression,undefined
"and he's plotting his divorce, they've decided to be discreet.",Client,depression,undefined
That must have hit you hard.,Client,depression,undefined
He thanked me for our time together,Client,depression,undefined
and told me that it had helped him through a rough patch,Client,depression,undefined
and that he would never forget me. Isn't that sweet?,Client,depression,undefined
"I almost called his wife right then and there, but I resisted.",Client,depression,undefined
"Then I went back to the office and the first face I saw was Stefanie,",Client,depression,undefined
glowing like a new bride.,Client,depression,undefined
You're very hurt.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No. You know, why... Why leave your 38-year-old wife",Client,anger,undefined
for your 43-year-old girlfriend,Client,anger,undefined
when you can nail a 25-year-old receptionist?,Client,anger,undefined
So you thought of yourself as Bennett's girlfriend?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, I guess I wasn't really thinking.",Client,anger,undefined
"You know, I can't do it. I can't play this game.",Client,anger,undefined
You mean the girlfriend game?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, the Stefanie game.",Client,anger,undefined
Where you giggle at bad jokes,Client,anger,undefined
and you collect friends on facebook and you drink chocolate martinis.,Client,anger,undefined
But in a way isn't that what you were trying to do when you went out with,Therapist,neutral,Open question
the baby lawyers on friday night?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I was trying to feel better, so I went on a spree. Have you never done that?",Client,anger,undefined
And that doesn't matter. It's not like I want to see guitar boy again.,Client,anger,undefined
Really? You described it as an olympic-quality night.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yes, that's good... once every four years.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't want a relationship with a child.,Client,neutral,undefined
Only men do that.,Client,neutral,undefined
He fell asleep at dawn and I went into the bathroom,Client,neutral,undefined
and I looked in the mirror and I knew it was time to go.,Client,neutral,undefined
Mornings after can be... can be harsh.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
In the daylight with the makeup smeared...,Client,depression,undefined
There was no hiding that I am old enough to be his mother.,Client,depression,undefined
You didn't feel that the night before?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He had power rangers towels hanging in his shower.,Client,depression,undefined
I just got dressed and I left.,Client,depression,undefined
Did you say goodbye?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Leave a note?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And I won't be sending flowers. You disapprove?,Client,anger,undefined
Do I?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's pretty obvious by your did I do this? Did I do that?,Client,anger,undefined
So do you feel that I'm judging you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Why don't you just say it, Paul?",Client,anger,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That I fucked two strangers and that it was immature,",Client,anger,undefined
that it was self-destructive.,Client,anger,undefined
And that's what you want to hear?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Shut up. Just talk like a person.,Client,anger,undefined
"Say Mia, you'll get a disease.",Client,anger,undefined
You'll getkilled.,Client,anger,undefined
The cop had a goddamn gun.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm not sure if you want me to scold you or to protect you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you have anything to say to me that's real?,Client,anger,undefined
Please don't ever do this again.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You'll get hurt.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I do not want you to get hurt.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You think that I was stupid?,Client,depression,undefined
"No, I think you were looking for something",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or someone.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Oh. You see, I knew you were gonna do this.",Client,anger,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Point out that I had picked up a musician in his 20s,",Client,anger,undefined
just like my old boyfriend Stevie.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, Stevie was a drummer and",Client,anger,undefined
anyone will tell you they are totally different.,Client,anger,undefined
Two weeks ago you did tell me that you wondered,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
if you had missed your chance with Steve,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and you wanted to go back to that moment,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
when you could've had him.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"If that's what I was trying to do, it didn't work... not in the morning.",Client,neutral,undefined
Exactly.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You saw in the mirror that you're a woman now,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and not a girl anymore, and maybe you didn't want to.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"If you did, you might have to see guitar boy again",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or give him a name.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think it's possible that he might've been a kind of symbol,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for roads not taken?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He was pretty great in bed for a symbol.,Client,neutral,undefined
Very good.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Okay, let's say that guitar boy was a symbol, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
So what am I doing with a cop?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, how did you feel when you were with him?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I felt safe.,Client,neutral,undefined
So the musician didn't make you feel young.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"In the daylight, you actually felt old.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So you found a cop,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
who treated you like a child,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
which made you feel safe.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How's that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's pretty good.,Client,depression,undefined
I thought I was just sleeping around.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you plan on seeing him again?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The cop? No. No.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't want to have to act like achildto have sex.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But you said it was fun, exciting.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He's married.,Client,depression,undefined
Did I leave that out? 'cause he did.,Client,depression,undefined
When did he tell you that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
When I guessed why he wouldn't drive me home.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's textbook.,Client,depression,undefined
Sounds like you've been down that road before...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"besides just Bennett, I mean.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You're on a roll. Any ideas why I do that?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I'd rather hear it from you.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Married men are unavailable?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I know it won't work out, so it allows me to maintain distance?",Client,neutral,undefined
The sex is always great 'cause married guys are starved for it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"There, does that cover it?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, since you're asking,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't think so.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I mean, when you have an affair with a married man",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
he has secrets with you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Secrets with you instead of his wife.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He's closer to you because you're his favorite.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's kind of similar in a way to what you were doing this morning.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Instead of sitting on the couch, you wanted to have breakfast",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"in the kitchen with me,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"together,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so that you'd feel different from my other patients.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Special.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is this better?,Client,anger,undefined
"It's not all about you, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
I know that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"In fact, when you were sitting in my kitchen, I remembered you telling me",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
about how you shared coffee with your dad at his store when you were a girl.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said that it was a secret,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that you both kept from your mother.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"What are you thinking, Mia?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Nothing. I don't think it's anything.,Client,neutral,undefined
My dad did come over for brunch on sunday.,Client,anger,undefined
And so the two of you spent the day together.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Did you invite him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
When?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That morning.,Client,neutral,undefined
"My mom dropped him off, happily.",Client,neutral,undefined
She probably went off to spend the day at her beauty parlor,Client,depression,undefined
where she likes to sit around and talk with her friends about,Client,depression,undefined
how I ruined her modeling career.,Client,depression,undefined
Is that her mantra?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
If she hadn't had me...,Client,depression,undefined
But she had more children after you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, 10 years later.",Client,depression,undefined
She treated my sisters like they were treasures.,Client,depression,undefined
But not you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, she shipped me off to New Jersey",Client,anger,undefined
when she was getting ready to have the twins.,Client,anger,undefined
But I thought you said that both your parents...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"My dad, he never would've done that if she hadn't forced him.",Client,anger,undefined
"So, no, I don't invite her.",Client,anger,undefined
"She didn't mind. If he hadn't come over, she would've had",Client,anger,undefined
to take care of him all day.,Client,anger,undefined
Take care of him? Is he ill?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He wasn't himself.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, I hadn't slept in two days, and he didn't even notice.",Client,neutral,undefined
He was coming down with something.,Client,neutral,undefined
He was coughing a lot and he spilled his coffee all over himself,Client,neutral,undefined
and I had him take off his clothes and I washed and dried everything.,Client,neutral,undefined
Like a parent.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He just sat there wrapped in a blanket.,Client,neutral,undefined
Not what you'd hoped for.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So you feel that your father should take care of you,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
make you feel loved?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
It should be unconditional no matter what he feels?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
No matter what you do?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Well, I told you he was having a bad day.",Client,neutral,undefined
We adore one another and he...,Client,neutral,undefined
he's definitely better than any guy I have ever dated.,Client,neutral,undefined
You make him sound perfect.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Is that bad?,Client,neutral,undefined
Can you think of a downside to it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
A downside to having a father who loves me? No.,Client,anger,undefined
The problem is I can't find anybody as good as him.,Client,anger,undefined
The problem is I can't find anybody as good as him.,Client,anger,undefined
"You think there's something wrong with that , don't you?",Client,anger,undefined
"For one thing, your father's married to your mother.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think there's any connection between that,Therapist,neutral,Open question
and your picking married men?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I said that I was done with that.,Client,anger,undefined
"You did, but you also asked me what that pattern was about.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Now you're gonna tell me that my father molested me?,Client,anger,undefined
Because he didn't.,Client,anger,undefined
I didn't think that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But your father has been an essential comfort for you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"For as long as you are his favorite, you won't ever be alone.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm getting the feeling that the tight bond,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
isn't entirely comfortable.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What do you mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
Look at this morning.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You came in, you crossed a boundary.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It made you feel special.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I think it also rattled you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Your speech was fast, graphic. You tried to provoke me.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You spilled something.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The spill was an accident.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Maybe, but what I'm saying, Mia,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is that it's not always a simple thing to be special.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I was thinking of the feeling that you had when you were eight,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
after the robbery in your father's store.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He held you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was too tight.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was life and death.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think it's possible that to separate from your father,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is to risk being entirely alone?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But to stay with him is to be uncomfortably close?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why are you doing this?,Client,depression,undefined
My dad is all I have.,Client,depression,undefined
No one else?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Colleagues, acquaintances.",Client,depression,undefined
Is he your closest relationship?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Are you his?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I feel sick.,Client,depression,undefined
I ate too much.,Client,depression,undefined
"This is like antitherapy. I walk in here feeling great,",Client,depression,undefined
I'm gonna leave feeling like crap.,Client,depression,undefined
Sometimes that happens.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And when it does, do you do anything?",Client,disgust,undefined
You want me to make you feel better?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't wanna feel like this forever.,Client,disgust,undefined
Like what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like this is my life.,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't want this to be my life.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't know what to do. What do I do?,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm gonna go.,Client,depression,undefined
You still have time.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Oh, do I?",Client,disgust,undefined
I'm 43 and I'm entirely alone... your words.,Client,disgust,undefined
You're right. Who do I have?,Client,disgust,undefined
You?,Client,anger,undefined
One session a week?,Client,anger,undefined
I want someone to go home to...,Client,anger,undefined
"Someone to be in my bed with me,",Client,anger,undefined
somebody who holds me when I cry. I just want that.,Client,anger,undefined
I know.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I just want that.,Client,depression,undefined
"I know I'm early, but it's cold in the waiting room.",Client,neutral,undefined
Can I come inside?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I have to leave this on.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Daniel might call and if he does, I'll have to go.",Client,neutral,undefined
How are you feeling?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
Good.,Client,neutral,undefined
So how did the conversation go with your mother?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I told you I'd call you after it was over.,Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't hear from you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You didn't have the conversation?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She was driving when you called her, right?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Right.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did she call you back?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you answer?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of course I answered. Don't I always answer?,Client,neutral,undefined
I couldn't tell her.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I wasn't in a place where I could talk.,Client,depression,undefined
Where were you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The lobby of Sloan-Kettering.,Client,depression,undefined
I just went to see how it would feel.,Client,depression,undefined
And...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How did it feel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like going to a hotel. Like checking into,Client,neutral,undefined
one of those fancy airport hotels in a city where nobody actually lives.,Client,neutral,undefined
There was this girl behind the desk. She was like my age.,Client,neutral,undefined
She smiled at me and...,Client,neutral,undefined
"she was like, Can I help you?",Client,neutral,undefined
"And I know that's just something you say to people, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
I sort of took her at face value in the moment and...,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was like, Can she help me?",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, probably not. I mean,",Client,neutral,undefined
she doesn't know how to cure cancer.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But still, she deals with it every day.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"The minute she looked at you, she must have known.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you telling me that she didn't...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, My mom,",Client,depression,undefined
just she called back and I had to leave to get reception.,Client,depression,undefined
"She was like,",Client,depression,undefined
Where are you? You sound funny.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I was like,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, mom, I'm...",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm actually a little sick.,Client,neutral,undefined
So she started to lecture me on how I don't take care of myself.,Client,disgust,undefined
I don't wash my hands when I get off of the subway,Client,disgust,undefined
and I need to stop biting my nails because I'm a grownup.,Client,disgust,undefined
She was really stressed out.,Client,depression,undefined
Why was she stressed out?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Daniel tried to kill himself...,Client,depression,undefined
Daniel tried to kill himself...,Client,depression,undefined
Again.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm sorry to hear that.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Last week you said he was doing better.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I should've realized that that was a warning sign.,Client,anger,undefined
What happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He tried to jump off the roof.,Client,anger,undefined
"Anyway he's meeting now with one of his old teachers, this...",Client,anger,undefined
this miracle worker... Mr. Heath.,Client,anger,undefined
He's the Anne Sullivan to Daniel's Helen Keller.,Client,neutral,undefined
He teaches at this special school for autistic boys.,Client,neutral,undefined
My parts sent Daniel there when he was 10.,Client,neutral,undefined
"They took out a second mortgage to pay for it,",Client,depression,undefined
because things had gotten so bad.,Client,depression,undefined
Daniel had,Client,depression,undefined
these two bald spots on either side of his head from hitting himself.,Client,depression,undefined
The hair just stopped growing in.,Client,depression,undefined
And what was it that this Mr. Heath,Therapist,neutral,Open question
did for Daniel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He got Daniel to wear a helmet for a while.,Client,depression,undefined
And daniel thought the...,Client,depression,undefined
helmet gave him special powers.,Client,depression,undefined
He thought it made him...,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"It made him what, April?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Just stay with the thought. It made him what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He thought it made him smart.,Client,depression,undefined
Anyway...,Client,neutral,undefined
He's supposed to...,Client,neutral,undefined
"He's supposed to call me after the meeting's over,",Client,neutral,undefined
so I might have to go pick him up.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, can't your mother do that?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
She's busy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, she...",Client,depression,undefined
She can't deal with him...,Client,depression,undefined
Not when he's this bad. Not when he wants to die.,Client,depression,undefined
Did he actually say that? I want to die?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, he says",Client,depression,undefined
"he wants to turn into a cloud and float away,",Client,depression,undefined
but he knows what would happen to him if he stepped off a building.,Client,depression,undefined
He's not stupid.,Client,depression,undefined
He just... He gets so tired of everything feeling so strange.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, right now the world must seem",Therapist,neutral,Approval
pretty strange to you as well.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"And you're going it alone,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
without any Mr. Heath,Therapist,neutral,Approval
to save you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Isn't that supposed to be your job?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, it is.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But if you don't let me in, I can't help you.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"And that scares me, because I'm afraid that if you don't,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
we'll waste the little time that we have left.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Jesus.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Kind of blunt today, aren't you?",Client,disgust,undefined
I think I'm depressed.,Client,depression,undefined
Okay. Tell me why.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Probably because I have cancer.,Client,depression,undefined
Right.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
But can you tell me what you're feeling?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm not feeling anything.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm just sort of sick,Client,depression,undefined
and tired and just...,Client,depression,undefined
"I don't know, just kind of disgusted with everything.",Client,depression,undefined
I'll be brushing my teeth and I'll look at myself in the mirror,Client,depression,undefined
"and suddenly I'll look so ugly,",Client,depression,undefined
just awful. And...,Client,depression,undefined
"And before I know it I'm on the bathroom floor,",Client,depression,undefined
"just starting at the lint in the bath mat, and I...",Client,depression,undefined
I have no idea how I'm going to get back up again.,Client,depression,undefined
That sounds like depression.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It also might be what happens when you feel,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that things are slipping out of your control.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's horrible.,Client,depression,undefined
"When you're feeling like that, I want you to call me.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Why?,Client,neutral,undefined
Listen to me.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"I don't care what time of the day or night it is, you call me.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Do you understand? That's what I'm here for.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You want to talk to me when I'm on the bathroom floor?,Client,neutral,undefined
Any time.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I saw my mom last week for the first time in a while.,Client,neutral,undefined
She took me to brunch.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what did you talk about?,Client,neutral,undefined
My brother.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did she notice how...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How tired you look?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I put on some makeup...,Client,neutral,undefined
"A lot of makeup, actually.",Client,neutral,undefined
So you didn't want her,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to not see you at your best.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I always try to look good when I see her.,Client,anger,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It makes her feel better.,Client,anger,undefined
But this last time I could've lost an arm,Client,anger,undefined
and she wouldn't have noticed.,Client,anger,undefined
Because of Daniel.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Sort of.,Client,anger,undefined
Also...,Client,anger,undefined
she wants to leave my father.,Client,anger,undefined
Did she tell you that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, It's not a big deal.",Client,disgust,undefined
She's been saying that for as long as I can remember.,Client,disgust,undefined
Life would be so much easier without your father.,Client,disgust,undefined
Never marry a workaholic. Blah blah blah.,Client,disgust,undefined
The fucked up thing is she doesn't actually want to leave him.,Client,anger,undefined
She's crazy about him.,Client,anger,undefined
She is.,Client,neutral,undefined
But she said she wanted to leave.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you think it's possible that,Therapist,neutral,Open question
what she wants to leave is Daniel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, I think your mother passes a lot of her anxiety on to you.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But I don't think the relationship is balanced,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because you don't pass your problems back to her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm sorry I brought her up. It's...,Client,neutral,undefined
You don't talk about your dad a lot in here.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I know.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't have that much to say about him.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's never around. He's always at the hospital.,Client,neutral,undefined
For a while when we were young...,Client,neutral,undefined
Daniel kept forgetting who he was.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He'd call him mister, like, Hey, mister.",Client,neutral,undefined
But Daniel kept getting worse as he got older and my dad couldn't handle it,Client,depression,undefined
and he just checked out.,Client,depression,undefined
On both of you?,Client,neutral,undefined
He and I have our own relationship.,Client,neutral,undefined
I used to wait up for him,Client,neutral,undefined
until he came home.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd sit with him while he ate his dinner.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He'd talk abouhis day, his patients.",Client,neutral,undefined
So he treated you like an adult.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It was nice.,Client,neutral,undefined
It sounds like he understands you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But he didn't raise me.,Client,neutral,undefined
He just got to sweep in at the end of the day,Client,neutral,undefined
and talk to the healthy child for 15 minutes.,Client,neutral,undefined
She was with Daniel day in and day out.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think part of the reason that you treasured those moments,Therapist,neutral,Open question
was because your dad was talking about something other than Daniel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She needs to talk to someone.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Of course. I understand that, but why couldn't she tell a friend?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
It wasn't anybody else's business.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's okay, paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
I could handle it.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wanted to handle it.,Client,neutral,undefined
She gets overwhelmed. She needs to vent.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So after she vents and she puts the stress, the disappointment",Client,neutral,undefined
"and the worry of her own life on your shoulders,",Client,neutral,undefined
who do you turn to?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Or do you just carry it with you, your burden and hers?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are we out of time?,Client,anger,undefined
"No, we don't have to worry about the time.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"You know, I've been...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I've been reading up on autism,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and it seems like there's some pretty,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
promising research coming out.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
There's never gonna be a cure.,Client,disgust,undefined
You seem pretty certain about that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's not a disease.,Client,disgust,undefined
"If it's not a disease, there can't be a cure.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Actually, some scientists seem to be reconsidering that assumption.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, that's because they're being funded by rich, desperate people.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Autistic children don't get better, they just get older.",Client,anger,undefined
I'm sorry if that sounds cynical.,Client,anger,undefined
"No, it doesn't.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
But you're right. Those children eventually become adults and their...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Their parents die.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And when that happens it falls on somebody else to take care of them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"In Daniel's case, that would be you, April,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for the rest of your life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm a horrible person.,Client,depression,undefined
Why would you say that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I don't want to do it.,Client,disgust,undefined
He ruined their lives. He ruined their marriage.,Client,disgust,undefined
You can't... You can't give Daniel what he needs,Client,disgust,undefined
and have any space for anyone else.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, your mother couldn't, but you're not your mother.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You can make different choices.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She didn't make any choices.,Client,anger,undefined
She gotstuck.,Client,anger,undefined
"She did, April.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
But every life is... It's a constellation of choices.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Nobody escapes making them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You mother made choices that kept her locked into Daniel.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You can choose differently.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
He's my brother.,Client,anger,undefined
"I'm not suggesting that you abandon him,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
but you don't know what the future holds for either of you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You don't know what sort of innovations,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
are gonna come along in the treatment of autism.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"You're not psychic, april.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You can't predict the future. You can't control it.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
The only thing you can do,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
in relation to the future now,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
is to decide whether or not you want to be in it.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I look like such shit right now.,Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, that's enough.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
We have to start talking now about chemo.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Hi, Daniel. How was your meeting?",Client,neutral,undefined
You didn't see Mr. Heath?,Client,neutral,undefined
Where are you?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm going to call you back in just one minute.,Client,neutral,undefined
Will you pick up the phone?,Client,neutral,undefined
Promise?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, bye.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Mr. Heath. Hi, it's April.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I know. I just spoke to him.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, he's fine. He's in Central Park.",Client,neutral,undefined
He's at the sailboat pond.,Client,neutral,undefined
He likes it there.,Client,neutral,undefined
But if I go and get him right now,Client,neutral,undefined
could I still bring him to see you today?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you still have time?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm in Brooklyn now, so it'll take me a few hours.",Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you so much.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Damn it, pick up.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Come on, pick up.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm gonna come and meet you in about an hour,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I want you to stay right where you are.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, will you do that? Will you stay?",Client,neutral,undefined
"All right, I'm gonna see you soon.",Client,neutral,undefined
What happened?,Client,neutral,undefined
You fainted!,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
No way.,Client,neutral,undefined
Yes way.,Therapist,anger,Communication Skills
You are sick,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
and you're not taking care of yourself. Sit down!,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
You need to eat.,Therapist,anger,Advisement
You need sugar in your system.,Therapist,anger,Advisement
You don't have to do that.,Client,neutral,undefined

Do you see what you're doing?,Therapist,anger,Open question
You're treating me just the way you treat your parents.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
Can we talk about it next week?,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you so afraid that I won't be able to help you?,Therapist,anger,Open question
"Yeah, I have to go.",Client,neutral,undefined
"2 minutes ago you were passed out on the couch,",Therapist,anger,Restatement
now you're off to save the world.,Therapist,anger,Restatement
I'm not going to save the world.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm going to save my brother.,Client,anger,undefined
Call your mother.,Therapist,anger,Advisement
Tell her to go get him.,Therapist,anger,Advisement
Why not?,Therapist,anger,Advisement
Because I can do it.,Client,anger,undefined
There has to be another option.,Therapist,anger,Advisement
You can't take care of everything and everybody all the time.,Therapist,anger,Advisement
Listen. It's okay if you can't handle this.,Client,anger,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I saw how you panicked there. I get it.,Client,anger,undefined
"It's scary what I have, what I'm going through.",Client,anger,undefined
I don't have to come back here if you can't handle it.,Client,anger,undefined
Is that what you think I was doing? You think I was panicking?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Come on, you freaked.",Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, let's say I freaked.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
What does that mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That means I can't come back here.,Client,anger,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because you can't handle me.,Client,anger,undefined
"It's possible to live in a world where people panic,",Therapist,anger,Interpretation
"where people let each other down,",Therapist,anger,Interpretation
where they disappoint each other but still help each other.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
I will get sicker and sicker.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm gonna keep passing out on your couch.,Client,anger,undefined
I'll probably vomit on your couch.,Client,anger,undefined
And then eventually,Client,anger,undefined
I'm gonna die on your couch. Is that really what you want?,Client,anger,undefined
No! I want you to go to chemotherapy!,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Do you even know what chemo is?!,Client,anger,undefined
It is poison that they administer directly to your heart!,Client,anger,undefined
They put this big pump right to your heart.,Client,anger,undefined
And do you know why?,Client,anger,undefined
"Because if they just gave you a shot and some of it got under your skin,",Client,anger,undefined
it would melt your fucking flesh!,Client,anger,undefined
That is not gonna happen to you!,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You don't know that.,Client,anger,undefined
You don't know anything.,Client,anger,undefined
You can't stop what's gonna happen to me.,Client,anger,undefined
"The nausea and the pain,",Client,anger,undefined

You'll tell me,Client,anger,undefined
that life is beautiful and I have to be brave,Client,anger,undefined
"and I'll say, yes yes yes, blah blah blah.",Client,anger,undefined
But I'll be lying and you know that I'll be lying.,Client,anger,undefined
And one morning you're gonna wake up and...,Client,anger,undefined
"say to yourself,",Client,anger,undefined
I just wish that fucking girl...,Client,anger,undefined
I just wish that fucking girl would leave me alone,Client,anger,undefined
so I can be happy again. You won't be able to handle it.,Client,anger,undefined
You won't.,Client,anger,undefined
So to help someone is... is torture.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's unbelievably painful. It's hell.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Yeah?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"If you let me help you, I will hate you for it.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

"And, April, I'm not going to sit here week after week",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
and watch you just slip away.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"We have to begin treatment today, now.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I tried. I told you I went there. I couldn't do it.,Client,sadness,undefined
Last week you said that the things we discuss in this room make sense,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Right now.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You should be happy about one thing:,Client,neutral,undefined
they took away my phone and my blackberry.,Client,neutral,undefined
I hated those things.,Client,disgust,undefined
In my day an exec never typed a note.,Client,disgust,undefined
Never took one.,Client,disgust,undefined
Never carried anything.,Client,disgust,undefined
I guess that makes me a dinosaur.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm glad you came.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I hope you don't feel any pressure today.,Client,joy,undefined

"I've lost my job, my name.",Client,depression,undefined
I can't leave the house.,Client,depression,undefined
There's a pack of reporters on the street waiting,Client,anger,undefined
for me to come out so they can stick microphones and cameras in my face.,Client,anger,undefined
So coming here today meant,Therapist,neutral,Approval
you had to run a... run a gauntlet.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I can handle that.,Client,neutral,undefined
I tell them the truth.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I did everything I was supposed to,",Client,neutral,undefined
that I took the pages straight from the playbook.,Client,neutral,undefined
What playbook is that?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Johnson & Johnson,",Client,neutral,undefined
the tylenol scandal.,Client,neutral,undefined
Seven dead from product tampering,Client,neutral,undefined

"Here, Connie let me read this one article...",Client,neutral,undefined

They came flat out and said I did everything right.,Client,anger,undefined
Played by the rules.,Client,anger,undefined
The only thing is the world's changed a lot since 1982.,Client,anger,undefined
It's more predatory.,Client,anger,undefined
The minute we assumed responsibility,Client,anger,undefined
"the bloggers, the press,",Client,anger,undefined
the class-action lawyers came after us.,Client,anger,undefined
Then the short-sellers hammered the stock down and that's when,Client,anger,undefined
the parasites in my own company saw this,Client,anger,undefined
as some fucking opportunity for themselves.,Client,anger,undefined
And then the Donaldsons capitulated.,Client,anger,undefined
A perfect storm they called it.,Client,anger,undefined
"When you read an article like this, how does it make you feel?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Like an old man,Client,depression,undefined

You feel like a... like a boxer,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

Are you a therapist or a pediatrician?,Client,neutral,undefined

And how many are you taking?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

Maybe three or four.,Client,neutral,undefined
A day?,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that the dosage that Dr. Wells has prescribed?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's what I need to sleep.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you have to let him know how many you're taking.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"I mean, you're not somebody who's had a lot of exposure to pills,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement

What do...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Come on, Paul!",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't quit. You know me better than that.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I would never leave a mess like that for my wife to clean up.,Client,neutral,undefined

I don't want to see anyone else. Tell them I'm sick.,Client,depression,undefined

How long have you worked for this man?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
35 years.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, when I came in,",Client,neutral,undefined
his son James was...,Client,neutral,undefined

"And a few years later, James went West to...",Client,neutral,undefined
look for some new markets.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And one night, he drove his car into a tree.",Client,neutral,undefined
Right away the sharks started circling the company.,Client,neutral,undefined

I promised him that,Client,neutral,undefined
"we would build something special,",Client,neutral,undefined
and we did.,Client,neutral,undefined
We did.,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you saying you turned him into one of the wealthiest men in the country?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I did okay too.,Client,neutral,undefined
And after 35 years,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
all he has to say is good luck?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

"It's not paranoia, if that's where you're going.",Client,depression,undefined

and why it happened.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"But as hard as you're working to deal with this guilt,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"this sense of betrayal,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it seems to me that you're working just as hard to avoid looking at him,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and his role in this.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why do you keep harping on him?,Client,anger,undefined
He did the best he could.,Client,anger,undefined
"You said that when his son James died,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
old Donaldson was ready to just...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
give it all up. But you wouldn't let him.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You took on the family business for 35 years.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Their son was dead.,Client,anger,undefined
And did you feel guilty about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'd promised to keep an eye on him.,Client,anger,undefined
"And so for what,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
some penance you took on this enormous responsibility?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The same way that you took responsibility for your parents' lives,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
after your brother Tommy died?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I had no choice.,Client,anger,undefined
"Walter, you were just a boy.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I had no choice.,Client,anger,undefined
You were six years old.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You shouldn't have been taking care of your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They should have been taking care of you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was my fault!,Client,anger,undefined
"That's why I had no choice, it was my fault.",Client,anger,undefined
What was your fault?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"A hot summer night,",Client,sadness,undefined
"before air conditioning,",Client,sadness,undefined
the air was dead still.,Client,sadness,undefined
Tommy was just going to sneak out to the quarry lake to cool off.,Client,sadness,undefined
He came to my room...,Client,sadness,undefined
and said...,Client,sadness,undefined
tonight was the night he was going to jump off the highest cliff.,Client,sadness,undefined
"He was asking me, really, more than telling me.",Client,sadness,undefined
And what did you tell him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I said, Tommy, you can do it.",Client,sadness,undefined
"You can do it, Tommy.",Client,sadness,undefined
And I told him in the morning I'd...,Client,sadness,undefined
brag about him to everyone.,Client,sadness,undefined
Then he kissed me good night.,Client,sadness,undefined
And he never made it back.,Client,sadness,undefined
And you felt responsible for your brother's death.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was.,Client,sadness,undefined
I am.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Walter, your brother",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
jumped. You didn't push him off the edge.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He chose to jump.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And in a flash,Client,sadness,undefined
a family was destroyed.,Client,sadness,undefined
That's it.,Client,sadness,undefined
It happens.,Client,sadness,undefined
There are lots of them...,Client,sadness,undefined
destroyed families.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Are you okay, Walter?",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I have to go.,Client,depression,undefined
"I know this week your sense of guilt about all this,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
it must feel like an avalanche. I know you must...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"feel overwhelmed,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
but it's urgent that we talk about this feeling,Therapist,neutral,Approval
in here.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
My wife's waiting for me outside.,Client,depression,undefined
Can we arrange something for tomorrow morning?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy

"I'm fine, fella.",Client,depression,undefined
Do you mind if I call your doctor and...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
talk about those prescriptions?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I said I'm fine.,Client,depression,undefined
I'll see you next week.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
My wife's waiting for me outside. ,Client,neutral,undefined
Sorry I'm late.,Client,neutral,undefined
Rosie kept me waiting for half an hour.,Client,neutral,undefined
She wanted to talk to me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Turns out all she wanted was the keys to the car.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you give her the keys?,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
Was she happy?,Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
I don't think so.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I guess I wanted to feel close to her, wanted to hear about school",Client,neutral,undefined
"and whether she has a boyfriend or not, how she's doing with Kate.",Client,neutral,undefined
"When you were all living together, did she tell you those things?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
She wouldn't have had to tell me because I would have seen them.,Client,neutral,undefined
I could overhear them or Kate would tell me.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you didn't have conversations then either?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you talk on the phone?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We try.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But, you know, I can always tell",Client,neutral,undefined
she's IMing her friends on the computer.,Client,neutral,undefined
So what can you do to feel close to her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. I don't know...,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you remember a time when you were living at home,Therapist,neutral,Open question
and you felt close to her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
There was one time...,Client,neutral,undefined
I took her. She broke her arm,Client,neutral,undefined
and Kate was out of town so...,Client,neutral,undefined
I got to take Rosie to the hospital.,Client,neutral,undefined
A lot of sitting...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Emergency room, treatment room...",Client,neutral,undefined
and we were waiting for the cast on her arm to dry.,Client,neutral,undefined
And it was just...,Client,neutral,undefined
Just me and Rosie.,Client,neutral,undefined
"All afternoon, just me and her.",Client,neutral,undefined
I read to her.,Client,neutral,undefined
I told her stories.,Client,neutral,undefined
Played 20 questions and I spy.,Client,neutral,undefined
That was a happy day.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, pretty sad, huh?",Client,neutral,undefined
I missed so much.,Client,neutral,undefined
What is it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing. I was just...,Client,neutral,undefined
I took...,Client,neutral,undefined
I took April to the hospital this week.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's your patient who has cancer.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, she wasn't...",Client,neutral,undefined

She wasn't getting treatment.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So after our session, I just...",Client,neutral,undefined
"got up, I took my coat and I just brought her to the hospital.",Client,neutral,undefined
I know it was wrong.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But you see, the oncologist had already made a treatment schedule",Client,neutral,undefined
so all she had to do was get there. So I took her there.,Client,neutral,undefined
I waited with her till she was finished,Client,neutral,undefined
and then I took her home.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you tell her stories?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, we were...",Client,neutral,undefined
just quiet.,Client,neutral,undefined
Were you reminded of the day,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you spent with Rosie in the hospital?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, I'd give the last 10 years of my life to...",Client,neutral,undefined
To be back in the hospital with Rosie that afternoon,Client,neutral,undefined
waiting for her cast to dry.,Client,neutral,undefined
I hate my life.,Client,depression,undefined
It's broken.,Client,depression,undefined
"Every day,",Client,depression,undefined
it hurts.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm not getting anything from my family,",Client,depression,undefined
"so I try to get it from my patients. I know it's wrong,",Client,depression,undefined
but who else do I have?,Client,depression,undefined
Who else do you have to get what you need from?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Nobody.,Client,depression,undefined
"But, okay, I have you.",Client,neutral,undefined
But you can't,Client,neutral,undefined
give me what I need.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's not your job.,Client,neutral,undefined
Let's talk about what you need.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

I don't need anything special. Just what...,Client,depression,undefined
What everybody needs.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, you have food.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You have clothing, you have shelter.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, sort of.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I have a den with no other bears. Is that shelter?,Client,neutral,undefined
You need some other bears?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I miss them.,Client,depression,undefined
You know what I'm talking about.,Client,depression,undefined
I know you do.,Client,depression,undefined
I do.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I miss dinner, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
I miss the after-dinner.,Client,depression,undefined
What do you do in Brooklyn between dinner and bedtime?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sometimes I go to...,Client,neutral,undefined
the local bar.,Client,neutral,undefined
They've got the soccer from England on.,Client,neutral,undefined
"That's good, so...",Client,neutral,undefined
Then I have... Have a drink.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, do you ever meet any women at the bar?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I see them.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know if they see me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm like that... That lonely guy,Client,neutral,undefined
"in the Edward Hopper painting, sitting at the bar.",Client,neutral,undefined
Tell me about the women.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Some of them are pretty, you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
They wear bracelets that jingle.,Client,neutral,undefined
They go outside to smoke.,Client,neutral,undefined
Like my patient Mia.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't think you've mentioned Mia.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She was a patient 20 years ago.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She came back this year. She's... Well, it's complicated.",Client,neutral,undefined
She's a lawyer that works for the firm,Client,neutral,undefined
that's handling the deposition. The lawsuit.,Client,neutral,undefined
We had a conversation about the case then she came back as a patient.,Client,neutral,undefined
"What do you mean, complicated?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Complicated emotionally.,Client,neutral,undefined
But...,Client,neutral,undefined
she's really smart.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she's...,Client,neutral,undefined
She's funny.,Client,neutral,undefined
Challenging?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I think you could throw that one in there, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
"She's also the kind of woman that,",Client,neutral,undefined
"if she managed to work through her issues,",Client,neutral,undefined
she could conceivably...,Client,neutral,undefined
be right for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not in love with her.,Client,neutral,undefined
But...,Client,neutral,undefined
Could see myself with somebody like her.,Client,neutral,undefined
You've cheered up just talking about her.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, I am drawn to her, yeah.",Client,joy,undefined
"But after last year and Laura,",Client,joy,undefined
I don't think I'm going to fall in love with another patient for a while.,Client,joy,undefined
Is that a relief!,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But is she in love with you? Is that why you mentioned her?,Client,neutral,undefined
No I mentioned her because...,Client,neutral,undefined
we're talking about things that I need.,Client,neutral,undefined
I need,Client,neutral,undefined
a woman.,Client,neutral,undefined
For sex?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Is that what women think that men...,Client,anger,undefined
really think that they want them just for sex?,Client,anger,undefined
"No, I was just asking you if you wanted sex.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Of course I want sex. I'm not dead.,Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, well... Then good.",Client,anger,undefined
That's something you need. That's our subject... What you need.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
So you need sex.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I need fun. I need release.,Client,anger,undefined
I need contact with another human.,Client,anger,undefined
How are things going with Tammy?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Not Tammy.,Client,anger,undefined
Have you been seeing her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You know I have.,Client,anger,undefined

"Well,",Client,neutral,undefined
she and I had coffee. Then we had drinks. Then...,Client,neutral,undefined
We had a night at my apartment.,Client,neutral,undefined
She was supposed to be traveling away on business.,Client,neutral,undefined
"A furtive afternoon, then it was over.",Client,neutral,undefined
You had sex?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, mother. Like bad children.",Client,neutral,undefined
We had sex.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Gee, I...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You knew it would happen.,Client,disgust,undefined
You made me promise not to.,Client,disgust,undefined
I sound like a really tough and jealous mother.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I won't let you have sex. I make you ask me for water.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You dared me to see her. You wanted to see,Client,anger,undefined
f I could,Client,anger,undefined
control myself.,Client,anger,undefined
I know how hard it is to resist an old lover.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Too bad I didn't have more of them.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I'd like to come back to Tammy in a little while, if that's okay.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I'd like to talk some more about the bears.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Have you seen your father?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

Did you go to see him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I didn't go to see him.",Client,anger,undefined
"I meant to, and...",Client,anger,undefined
Why not? Is he better?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. He may have taken a turn for the worse.,Client,anger,undefined
He fell a few times in the hospital so they moved him into another room.,Client,anger,undefined
He might have a fever. I'm getting all this...,Client,anger,undefined
from Patrick.,Client,anger,undefined
I was busy preparing this week for the deposition.,Client,anger,undefined
"That was a treat, let me tell you.",Client,anger,undefined
So you didn't go see your father.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, I didn't. And if you don't stop nagging me, I won't.",Client,anger,undefined
"I'm not nagging you, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm reminding you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that bears do not live forever.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And this bear, with whom you have very many unresolved issues,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
he's dying.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
My brother says he's dying.,Client,anger,undefined
That doesn't really mean that he is dying.,Client,anger,undefined
Would you rather just get a call that he's dead?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Let them call my fucking brother!,Client,anger,undefined
"You may think that you don't care about this, but you do.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"If you didn't care, why would you have reacted this way when I brought him up?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Paul, please sit down.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"You say you're not getting what you need from anyone, but it's worse than that.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's as though you're a baby.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You woke up from a nap,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and you started crying, but nobody is coming in to see what you need.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And so you cry louder and you shake the bars of the crib.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And still nobody comes.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The only problem is your father is there.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"He's in the room with you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but your anger at him is so profound that you can't see him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
My father can't help me now.,Client,anger,undefined
"No, he probably can't.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But until you acknowledge his presence in your life,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're not going to understand anything about him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you'll continue to shake the crib.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What? I'm a grown man.,Client,anger,undefined
Of course you are.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But what you haven't been is a grown son to your father.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And until you do that, part of you is always gonna stay a baby.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Or at best, a teenager waiting for your mother to die.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
My mother's already dead.,Client,sadness,undefined
That's right.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"What you're afraid of, it's already happened.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Neither you nor your dad could stop it.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And the only thing you can do now is,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
hope to heal this wound so then you can move on.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
We both know,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
what it's like not to be there at the end.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's something you don't get over.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Ever.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Hello, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Paul, are you all right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm so sorry about your father.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Uh, thank you.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I found out from Ellis at work.,Client,neutral,undefined
How are you?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm... I'm fine.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You can't really be fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I know that I'm not supposed to talk to your lawyer,",Client,neutral,undefined
but you never canceled on me before.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Some things are bigger than protocol, aren't they?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, life and death,",Client,neutral,undefined
and losing a father.,Client,neutral,undefined
Paul?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's ironic that we were talking about your father last session.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I've thought about that.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, the strange thing is I haven't spoken to him since then.",Client,neutral,undefined
But I can't imagine what I would do if...,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
This is not about me today.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you get my card?,Client,neutral,undefined
I stood in that store forever,Client,neutral,undefined
"trying to pick it out, you know? What kind of picture?",Client,neutral,undefined
What kind of message?,Client,neutral,undefined
What did you think?,Client,neutral,undefined
I haven't read it yet.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Because I sent it?,Client,neutral,undefined
You were away all last week and you haven't opened your mail?,Client,neutral,undefined
That's not a good sign.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sounds like you're worried about me.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You do look tired,Client,neutral,undefined
and you're not wearing a jacket.,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you sleeping?,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you eating?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I'm fine.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You said that before.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I know that you have to be the neutral shrink,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but, you know, this is a relationship of a sort, isn't it?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, it is.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I appreciate your sympathy.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Granted, I am not the first person you would reach out to.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Our last couple of sessions, I have been...",Client,neutral,undefined
A challenge to put it mildly.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I was concerned.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wondered who do you have?,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know if you're close to your ex. I assume your kids are with her.,Client,neutral,undefined
You haven't been in New York that long and it's hard to find friends.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, are you worried I'm lonely?",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"No offense, but I can see it in your face.",Client,neutral,undefined
Is it possible that you're afraid I'm not ready,Therapist,neutral,Open question
to give you my full attention today?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, that's not it. I mean, this is me being caring.",Client,neutral,undefined
Is that okay?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, of course it is.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's not what you...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Look, you don't have to worry",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
about my feelings.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Does anybody?,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you rather I yell at you for canceling?,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you saying you felt like yelling when I canceled?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It was fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
No other reaction?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I got over it.,Client,neutral,undefined
Before or after you had seen Ellis?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Okay, true, I went to Ellis.",Client,neutral,undefined
Also true I was a little upset...,Client,neutral,undefined
more than a little.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then I felt like a jerk when I found out why you had canceled.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But that was last week,",Client,depression,undefined
and now everything's changed.,Client,depression,undefined
Why is that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I'm pregnant.,Client,joy,undefined
"Oh, that's...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
... that's really...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
big news.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
No kidding.,Client,joy,undefined
Are you surprised?,Client,joy,undefined
"Me too,",Client,joy,undefined
especially with my F.S.H. levels.,Client,joy,undefined
It's strange timing with us...,Client,joy,undefined
life and death.,Client,joy,undefined
Do you wanna have the session out in the snow? I mean...,Client,neutral,undefined
Sorry. You were telling me about your...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
F.S.H. levels.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"No, we were past that.",Client,neutral,undefined
I was talking about our timing.,Client,neutral,undefined
20 years ago you were having your first child and I was losing mine.,Client,neutral,undefined
So have you been thinking about that time?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's different this time. I know everybody says,Client,joy,undefined
"you get pregnant and everything changes, but it's really true.",Client,joy,undefined
My body feels totally different.,Client,joy,undefined
I've stopped smoking.,Client,joy,undefined
There's this preschool on my block,Client,joy,undefined
that I always avoid because it's...,Client,joy,undefined
"moms with their humvee strollers blocking everyone,",Client,joy,undefined
like they're privileged because they procreated.,Client,joy,undefined
Now I just walk through smiling.,Client,joy,undefined
So you went from jealousy,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to feeling like part of the club.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"At work, Bennett...",Client,neutral,undefined
"who's leaving friday, finally...",Client,neutral,undefined
"he had asked me to take over this big case,",Client,neutral,undefined
assuming that I would just crush the other side as usual.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I took one look at the poor family and I cut a deal.,Client,neutral,undefined
He was pissed.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're sure you're not trying to punish Bennett?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He's marrying stefanie.,Client,neutral,undefined
That'll be punishment enough.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I feel bad for their kid, you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, he's a double adulterer and she's a bimbo.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why are we talking about Bennett?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, you brought him up.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And he is somebody that you did want to have a child with.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's... it's not his.,Client,neutral,undefined
I did the math.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Still, it's interesting that you found out that Bennett",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
was having a baby and a couple of weeks later you're pregnant.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Are you saying that I'm competing with Bennett?,Client,disgust,undefined
That's what you think I think?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that's what you think I think?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Paul, I'm having a baby because I went on a sex spree",Client,neutral,undefined
that weekend without using protection.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe that wasn't the smartest thing but maybe it was.,Client,neutral,undefined
So maybe you weren't just being reckless. Maybe you maybe you're trying to get pregnant...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I figure it was guitar boy,Client,joy,undefined
"and not the middle-aged cop, which is good,",Client,neutral,undefined
because there won't be any paternity issues if I decide not to tell.,Client,neutral,undefined
Guitar boy doesn't even have my number or my last name.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you don't want him involved?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I know the baby needs a father, but not one like that.",Client,neutral,undefined
Does this silence mean you're appalled?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hey, I'm pregnant.",Client,neutral,undefined
I thought that,Client,neutral,undefined
"you would be happy,",Client,neutral,undefined
that we'd celebrate.,Client,neutral,undefined
This is really bad timing. I know.,Client,neutral,undefined
"What would you like me to say, Mia?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Wow, Mia! That's amazing!",Client,neutral,undefined
"You came saying you wanted a family, a child,",Client,neutral,undefined
and then you got it. Congratulations.,Client,neutral,undefined
"In other words, you had a problem and now you have a solution?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, can't that happen ever?",Client,anger,undefined
Of course. It sounds ideal.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
What else would you like to hear from me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
This game again?,Client,disgust,undefined
How about,Client,neutral,undefined
don't worry.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're going to be a good mom and I'll be there for you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Could you tell me what that means, i'll be there for you?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I have major decisions to make.,Client,neutral,undefined
Like what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like do I need a doula? Should I have genetic testing?,Client,neutral,undefined
Will my apartment be big enough?,Client,neutral,undefined
And you want me to help you with this those decisions?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How much time should I take off?,Client,neutral,undefined
Or should I just quit and move to the country?,Client,neutral,undefined
These are all big questions.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Your sisters have children. Have you spoken to them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They're busy with their own kids. And my mother? Forget it.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And my dad, he loves his grandchildren, but",Client,disgust,undefined
he doesn't do anything.,Client,disgust,undefined
He just lets them admire him.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You sound sure that your mother wouldn't want to help you,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but she did with your sisters.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's different...,Client,depression,undefined
"they're younger, they're married...",Client,depression,undefined
And she actually likes them.,Client,depression,undefined
And she doesn't like you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
For me she was less of a mom and more of,Client,neutral,undefined
a vase...,Client,neutral,undefined
"beautiful, but hard to the touch.",Client,neutral,undefined
That's a very powerful image.,Client,neutral,undefined
She was beautiful,Client,neutral,undefined
until I ruined her figure.,Client,neutral,undefined
Oh yes... her mantra.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Has that been on your mind this week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I've always kept in shape. I think men like that and now that'll all go.,Client,neutral,undefined
I hear your feet get bigger. I hate big feet.,Client,fear,undefined
Not to mention what birth does to,Client,fear,undefined
sex.,Client,fear,undefined
"I mean, you've been there.",Client,fear,undefined
"It stretches, right?",Client,fear,undefined
The size of a baby's head,Client,fear,undefined
compared to the size of a penis? That can't be good.,Client,fear,undefined
"And the man thing is over, isn't it?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Guys my age, they have grown kids.",Client,neutral,undefined
"They don't want to change diapers again. I mean, would you?",Client,neutral,undefined
What... what are you asking me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Come on, Paul, just answer my question.",Client,neutral,undefined
If someone like me would be attracted to a woman like you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
We've already done that. I get it... we're not a couple.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm saying hypothetically,Client,fear,undefined
"if I got fat, emotional...",Client,fear,undefined
more emotional...,Client,fear,undefined
if I had to cater to an infant...,Client,fear,undefined
I don't think that rules out all men.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So I could still get the drooling guy on the back of the 6 train?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, look, having a child can ruin even a good relationship.",Client,depression,undefined
Is that what happened to you?,Client,depression,undefined
Your wife did all the child-rearing,Client,depression,undefined
while you sat in that chair listening to people's problems?,Client,depression,undefined
She actually dealt with people's problems? It must've pissed her off.,Client,depression,undefined
"Obviously, something did.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
But I'd rather talk about your anger than my ex-wife's.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Fair enough.,Client,neutral,undefined
Who... whose are those?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yours or your kids?,Client,neutral,undefined
And why are they in here?,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you this responsive with your kids,Client,anger,undefined
or are you different as a dad?,Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, great. You're bored? You're annoyed?",Client,anger,undefined
You can't wait till I get out of here?,Client,anger,undefined
And we're back to your default... that I want to kick you out.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You did just look at your watch. You have never done that.,Client,anger,undefined
I've never worn a watch before.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That is not the point.,Client,anger,undefined
I am right. You should not be working this week.,Client,anger,undefined
"I'm fine, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"If I said i'm fine four times, you would be all over me.",Client,anger,undefined
"You're not even in the room, emotionally. Admit it.",Client,anger,undefined
Why did you look at your watch?,Client,anger,undefined
It's my father's watch.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm sorry. I must have glanced without meaning to,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
when you mentioned the word dad.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's not even ticking.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Time stops when I'm here.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If I wasn't pregnant, we could call it a day and goo a bar.",Client,neutral,undefined
That would be better for both of us.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is this the bar in soho where you hoped we'd run into each other?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, although this time we could act like we'd just met.",Client,joy,undefined
"As in hello, is this seat taken?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Right. And I'd say, No, hi,",Client,neutral,undefined
I just found out I'm pregnant after a binge weekend of anonymous sex.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you would say my father just died. Then,Client,neutral,undefined
we'd get plastered and fly to vegas and get married.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know me, I'd fuck it up. But it was fun, wasn't it?",Client,depression,undefined
I can see how we both could think it would solve our problems.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Don't go overboard.,Client,anger,undefined
"Mia, I think there's two issues here:",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"one, your feelings about the pregnancy;",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"two, your feelings about not having a partner.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it could be that they're...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Intertwined.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I mean, you've said a few times that it feels like",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm not in the room today.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You mentioned you're worried that having a baby is gonna make you feel,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
less physically attractive.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is it that you're afraid that no one will be there for you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
if you have a child?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I will be a single mom.",Client,fear,undefined
That's... harder.,Client,fear,undefined
Yes. It can be.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"And okay, I admit it isn't my first choice",Client,fear,undefined
but I can't have my first choice.,Client,fear,undefined
This is what I have.,Client,fear,undefined
It's not picture perfect.,Client,fear,undefined
And what's picture perfect?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Me, a baby and a man.",Client,neutral,undefined
And what kind of man?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What? I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
No idea?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's not the point. Why aren't you encouraging me?,Client,anger,undefined
You're in the mood to celebrate and you feel that I'm not joining in that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, I think that you think that I'm too fucked up,",Client,anger,undefined
and a disaster.,Client,anger,undefined
You know that's not what I said.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Never mind. I will call guitar boy. I'm sure he'll take full responsibility.,Client,anger,undefined
Or... or I'll just do it all on my own.,Client,anger,undefined
"I'll quit my job, I'll gain 100 lbs",Client,anger,undefined
and I'm sure I'll still be as good as my mom except that,Client,anger,undefined
this baby won't have a dad.,Client,anger,undefined
Why don't you just take a breath?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"God, I need to smoke. Oh. You won't let me.",Client,anger,undefined
I thought you had quit because you're pregnant.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
One cigarette isn't going to do any harm.,Client,anger,undefined
I'd rather you didn't.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"I'm in withdrawal, okay?",Client,anger,undefined
I think you're agitated.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Why do people have children anyhow?,Client,neutral,undefined
They want little versions of themselves,Client,neutral,undefined
to gaze up and say i love you?,Client,neutral,undefined
They want to relive their own childhoods?,Client,neutral,undefined
That... that is the last thing I want to do.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The truth is I like visiting my nieces,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I cannot wait to get home.,Client,disgust,undefined
You don't give me that sense.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"What was I thinking, sleeping around like that?",Client,anger,undefined
"If I had wanted a child, I would've had one by now.",Client,anger,undefined
Maybe I should give it up for adoption.,Client,anger,undefined
You don't want to have the baby?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm just...,Client,anger,undefined
"Go on, Mia. Just talk through it.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Tell me what you're feeling. It's okay.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
These feelings.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Shut up. It's not okay.,Client,anger,undefined
"This isn't just my feelings. This is it,",Client,anger,undefined
right?,Client,anger,undefined
This is my last chance...,Client,depression,undefined
And I'm... I'm too scared?,Client,depression,undefined
This sounds very similar to what you were saying 20 years ago.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're right.,Client,depression,undefined
"This is just how it felt back then, isn't it?",Client,depression,undefined
I didn't want to have a baby. I wanted to have an abortion.,Client,depression,undefined
And is that what you want to do now?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No. I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, come on, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
We both know I'm...,Client,depression,undefined
I shouldn't go through with this.,Client,depression,undefined
"Mia, look, I understand that you may be feeling just...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
overwhelmed right now...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, you think?",Client,depression,undefined
But you are in a very different place than you were back then.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Some of your concerns are... they're practical.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You can handle them now.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know how to hire a nanny, how to buy a bigger apartment,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
how to make a living.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But maybe the real question is,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
do you want to raise a child,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
if you have to do it on your own?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Will you help me?,Client,depression,undefined
I... I can help you as your therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Well, I know, but I've never been a mother - and you're the father.",Client,depression,undefined
I'm the father?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"N... no, I misspoke.",Client,depression,undefined
You're not the father.,Client,depression,undefined
You're a father.,Client,depression,undefined
"Nevertheless, you did want us to celebrate,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you asked if I would stick with you if you were pregnant,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and then you imagined how we might run away and get married.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"So if you're creating a new family, Mia,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it's possible that you'd like me to be there...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in the picture or in the room.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And here we are.,Client,depression,undefined
And now I just want you to tell me that,Client,depression,undefined
having a baby means I won't be alone for the rest of my life.,Client,depression,undefined
"Actually, I can tell you that in my experience at times it feels like",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"when you have a child, you'll never be alone again,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
or even have a moment to yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Who... who else have you told about the pregnancy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
This time?,Client,neutral,undefined
No one.,Client,neutral,undefined
Even after you took the test?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I think you're right, Paul. I do want to pull you in.",Client,depression,undefined
"Of course, you know I...",Client,depression,undefined
I'm scared. I'm worried about doing it on my own.,Client,depression,undefined
But I heard what you said. I'm not the same person I was 20 years ago.,Client,depression,undefined
There's just this new life.,Client,neutral,undefined
I can feel it.,Client,neutral,undefined
And this time I want it.,Client,neutral,undefined
You really do.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And I'll try my best to be a good mother...,Client,fear,undefined
Even if I'm afraid and even if it's just me.,Client,fear,undefined
I think maybe this is a good place to stop.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Wow, that went fast.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd better get going.,Client,neutral,undefined
The subways are going to be all screwed up.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you... you should take the rest of the day off...,Client,neutral,undefined
a snow day.,Client,neutral,undefined
Go for a walk in the park.,Client,neutral,undefined
Eat something.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"And, Paul...",Client,neutral,undefined
Please be happy for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Nice cap.,Client,neutral,undefined
Those stairs were so hard for me.,Client,joy,undefined
"This keeps happening, you're gonna have to start giving me therapy at chemo.",Client,joy,undefined
Two birds with one stone.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You know what I like best about you?,Client,joy,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
My morbid sense of humor?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Your eyes.,Client,joy,undefined
I remember the first time I came here,Client,joy,undefined
"and as I was leaving I looked at you,",Client,joy,undefined
and you looked at me and I lost my breath for a moment.,Client,joy,undefined
It's a compliment.,Client,joy,undefined
I know.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Don't worry. I'm not gonna jump you.,Client,joy,undefined
I'm in chemo... I can barely keep my food down.,Client,joy,undefined
"You know, they have drugs they can give you",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
that can counteract the nausea.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You're not even my type.,Client,joy,undefined
But your eyes are...,Client,joy,undefined
Bottomless.,Client,joy,undefined
I'm just saying.,Client,joy,undefined
Are you okay?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I just... I forget I can't do that anymore,Client,neutral,undefined
because of the thing I have there now.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does the port hurt all the time?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Only if I move a certain way.,Client,neutral,undefined
I can't remember them cutting me open.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I didn't faint or anything, did I?",Client,neutral,undefined
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you remember them putting it in?,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you watch it happen?,Client,neutral,undefined
Not... not all of it.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
'Cause you didn't want to see my breasts?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Trust me, there's nothing really to see.",Client,neutral,undefined
But thank you for not looking.,Client,neutral,undefined
And thank you for taking me.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're welcome.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"You know, It's funny... I've had so many conversations with you in my head",Client,joy,undefined
over these last two weeks.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, literally every day we've talked",Client,joy,undefined
"for, like, hours at a time.",Client,joy,undefined
We've had whole arguments in my head and then we've made up.,Client,joy,undefined
And what... What have we argued about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Whether life is just bullshit or there's something deeper behind it.,Client,joy,undefined
And what do I say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, You don't say much even in my head, which I find frustrating.",Client,joy,undefined
But when I asked you,Client,neutral,undefined
"if it was all worth it, you said,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Of course it is, April,",Client,neutral,undefined
if you make yourself and others happy.,Client,neutral,undefined
What?,Client,joy,undefined
I'm such an optimist,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
in your head.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You wouldn't have said that?,Client,joy,undefined
What you're essentially doing,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is giving yourself advice in the form of my voice.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I know.,Client,neutral,undefined
And very sound advice it is.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You're taking very good care of yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Once I asked you not to give up on me.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what did I say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You said, Never.",Client,neutral,undefined
I just want to haze you for a while.,Client,neutral,undefined
What do you think I meant by that?,Client,neutral,undefined
You're testing me.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how do you pass?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I live.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you get extra points for telling your parents?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Isn't it amazing how many people have cancer?,Client,joy,undefined
"And just, like, having conversations, doing sudoku.",Client,joy,undefined
Did you see those two girls in the corner on the computer?,Client,joy,undefined
They were shopping online...,Client,joy,undefined
For underwear.,Client,joy,undefined
We have catheters coming out of our fucking hearts,Client,joy,undefined
and they're buying new bras.,Client,joy,undefined
"You know, sometimes a little denial is not a bad thing...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
but don't tell anybody I said that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm sorry I've been such an asshole in here.,Client,neutral,undefined
I told you... no apologies.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I mean, I didn't answer your calls.",Client,neutral,undefined
I made you let me talk to Sienna during a session.,Client,disgust,undefined
I smashed my freaking model in your office and I left it for you to clean up.,Client,disgust,undefined
I must be the worst patient you've ever had.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Oh no, you're not.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Thank you for taking me.,Client,neutral,undefined
And thank you for going.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"No, really.",Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
I heard that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I had a bad night last week...,Client,sadness,undefined
Just a few days after the chemo.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I wanted to call you, but...",Client,sadness,undefined
Why didn't you call me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You canceled our session. I thought you needed a break.,Client,depression,undefined
"April, That was nothing to do with you.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It doesn't matter.,Client,neutral,undefined
I called my best friend Leah instead.,Client,neutral,undefined
Leah.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I haven't heard you mention her name before.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What did you say to her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I...",Client,neutral,undefined
I had woken up from this dream,Client,neutral,undefined
where I was already dead,Client,neutral,undefined
or...,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, not exactly. It was more like I knew",Client,neutral,undefined
"that I was about to die, like something was coming to kill me.",Client,neutral,undefined
It was horrible.,Client,neutral,undefined
But...,Client,neutral,undefined
"I also kind of wanted it to happen,",Client,neutral,undefined
just to get it over with.,Client,neutral,undefined
There's another way of looking at that dream.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe it's just the part of you that refuses help...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't want to talk about what the dream means.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was just, you know, setting the stage.",Client,neutral,undefined
Understood.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Anyway, I woke up",Client,depression,undefined
"with this really high fever,",Client,depression,undefined
like so high I was shaking... I couldn't even hold a glass of water.,Client,depression,undefined
And I totally freaked.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, I really thought it was all about to end.",Client,depression,undefined
That's why I called Leah.,Client,depression,undefined
She came right over.,Client,depression,undefined
And she took one look at me and called 911.,Client,depression,undefined
On the way there the ambulance guys were asking me if I was on any medication,Client,depression,undefined
"that they should know about. And I said,",Client,depression,undefined
"Well, chemo.",Client,depression,undefined
So was Leah in the ambulance with you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And her mouth just...,Client,depression,undefined
sort of hit the floor. And...,Client,depression,undefined
I was so out of it I just started apologizing.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called, but...",Client,depression,undefined
"I'm dying, and...",Client,depression,undefined
She took my hand and...,Client,depression,undefined
"she said, April, you don't die this quickly.",Client,depression,undefined
She sounds like a true friend.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She really is.,Client,depression,undefined
Yet you hadn't told her about the cancer till then.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I haven't seen her for a while.,Client,depression,undefined
"She's in law school, so she's been really busy.",Client,depression,undefined
Have you known each other for long?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We shared a bus stop with a bunch of other kids.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When I was 10, Daniel came to school with me for the first time.",Client,neutral,undefined
He was trying kindergarten.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was so afraid that everybody was gonna make fun of him.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And that first day, I turned around",Client,neutral,undefined
"for just a second and when I turned back around,",Client,neutral,undefined
daniel was standing there singing,Client,neutral,undefined
and holding his penis.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I wanted to die right there.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, everybody was staring at him.",Client,neutral,undefined
Nobody said anything,Client,neutral,undefined
until...,Client,joy,undefined
"Until Leah said, Daniel,",Client,joy,undefined
"you can sing or you can hold your penis,",Client,joy,undefined
but you cannot sing and hold your penis.,Client,joy,undefined
Everybody started laughing.,Client,joy,undefined
Then all the guys started singing and holding their own dicks.,Client,joy,undefined
It was amazing.,Client,joy,undefined
So she's always looked out for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We've looked out for each other.,Client,neutral,undefined
We've looked out for each other.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Her mom died when we were in high school,",Client,neutral,undefined
so she came to live with us for a while.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's really more like a sister than a friend.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, her reaction when...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
When you called her reminded me of,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"how Kyle reacted when you called him,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"when you were having trouble with the model, remember?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You said that he also,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
came right over.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, so?",Client,joy,undefined
So it seems like the people in your life are very committed to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I have good taste in people.,Client,joy,undefined
I think it's more than that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think that you demand,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
incredible loyalty.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So the only people you allow to get close to you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"are the people you feel that can measure up,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
people you feel that can really go the distance.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm incredibly loyal to them as well.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, I know that.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
So why are you making it sound like it's a bad thing?,Client,neutral,undefined
I guess I just wonder why you work so hard to make friends who are...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"so fiercely devoted to you and then,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"when you need help, you seem reluctant to rely upon them.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I called leah.,Client,anger,undefined
"Yeah, that's true,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
but you waited until you thought that you were dying.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's like a bank.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You keep taking money out,",Client,neutral,undefined
then eventually there'll be nothing left.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you think that there's only a limited amount of support,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that one person can offer another,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"and when that support is used up, it's gone forever?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"If Leah had cancer, would you get tired of helping her?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
But not everyone is like me.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what do you mean everybody is not like you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"In the emergency room,",Client,neutral,undefined
the doctor told me I should expect,Client,neutral,undefined
more fevers just like this one.,Client,neutral,undefined
"As he said it, I saw Leah's face.",Client,depression,undefined
She just looked terrified.,Client,depression,undefined
For herself or for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Enough. I get it. I mean, I get what you're trying to say.",Client,neutral,undefined
I just don't agree with you. Is that okay?,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Not everyone is like me, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm right.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I don't think you're crazy, April.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You canceled our session last week.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yes, I'm...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm sorry about that.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How did you feel when you got the message?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, considering we've determined that I have a tough time",Client,neutral,undefined
"elying on people, it was a pretty ballsy move on your part.",Client,neutral,undefined
What happened?,Client,neutral,undefined
I had a family,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
emergency.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So what happened?,Client,joy,undefined
You don't want to tell me?,Client,joy,undefined
Come on. I told you I have cancer.,Client,joy,undefined
Just know that if I could've been there for you...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I would have been.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I know that.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hey, how old are you?",Client,neutral,undefined
A bit... a bit passed 50.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"'Cause I was thinking this week, when...",Client,depression,undefined
When Leah's mom died she was 35...,Client,depression,undefined
We were 15 and she was 35... And I remember,Client,depression,undefined
"her being so old, like middle-aged, and...",Client,depression,undefined
now she seems so young to me.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I was wondering,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, if I make it to 35,",Client,neutral,undefined
"will I look back on the time in here and think,",Client,neutral,undefined
When I was 23,Client,neutral,undefined
"and Paul was 50, he seemed middle-aged.",Client,neutral,undefined
And now he seems so young.,Client,joy,undefined
You'll have to let me know when you get there.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
So we'll keep in touch?,Client,neutral,undefined
My hair started falling out.,Client,depression,undefined
They say I'll...,Client,depression,undefined
wake up one day next week and the rest of it will just,Client,depression,undefined
be there on the pillow.,Client,depression,undefined
It's gonna be hard to keep it from my parents after that happens.,Client,depression,undefined
I guess you and I should start strategizing.,Client,depression,undefined
Or maybe you could just tell them.,Client,depression,undefined
I bet you and my dad would actually get along.,Client,depression,undefined
You're both sort of intense in the same way.,Client,depression,undefined
I think you should be part of that conversation.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
We could ask them to come with you to therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
That might work.,Client,neutral,undefined
We could schedule something before your next chemotherapy session.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"No, we can't.",Client,depression,undefined
It's tomorrow.,Client,depression,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Who's gonna take you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You?,Client,depression,undefined
And what about Leah?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What about her?,Client,neutral,undefined
What about her?,Client,neutral,undefined
Wouldn't you prefer if she took you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you not want to take me?,Client,depression,undefined
It's not a question of whether I want to take you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Okay, are you refusing to take me?",Client,anger,undefined
You still haven't told your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So?,Client,anger,undefined
So you've got a whole system of support in place that you're not using.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't want my mother to take me to chemo.,Client,anger,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I want you to take me.,Client,anger,undefined
I think we should talk about why you still can't tell this to your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Is this some kind of a joke?,Client,anger,undefined
"No, it's not.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I am your therapist and you need one a therapist, but you also need a caregiver",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
and I cannot be both people.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You mean you won't.,Client,anger,undefined
It isn't appropriate.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, but you've already taken me.",Client,anger,undefined
I... I had to do that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Nobody forced you.,Client,anger,undefined
It was the right thing to do.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"April, you are very sick, but I crossed a line.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
What line?! There's no line!,Client,anger,undefined
There needs to be a line if I'm to continue being your therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
You just drew the damn line!,Client,anger,undefined
"April, listen to me.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I knew you couldn't take it.,Client,anger,undefined
I knew as soon as you saw that...,Client,anger,undefined
"them put that port into my heart, you said, Fuck this shit.",Client,anger,undefined
This isn't my daughter. This isn't my problem.,Client,anger,undefined
What's going on?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Tell me.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I can't.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Yes, you can.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I can't do this.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm gonna fail your fucking test.,Client,sadness,undefined
"No, you won't.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
People die of this shit every day.,Client,sadness,undefined
"But not everyone is as strong as you, remember?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I thought you were gonna take care of me.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm trying.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, you're dropping me.",Client,sadness,undefined
"No, I'm not dropping you.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I'm here for you, April, as your therapist.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Until you're not.,Client,sadness,undefined
I was so scared last week.,Client,sadness,undefined
I dreamt I was dead.,Client,sadness,undefined
I need you then. I know.,Client,sadness,undefined
I had a family,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
emergency.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What happened? Did your dog die?,Client,sadness,undefined
My father.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What?,Client,sadness,undefined
It's okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
He...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
He'd been sick for a while.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Your father died?,Client,sadness,undefined
How could you let me,Client,sadness,undefined
go on blathering like this,Client,sadness,undefined
when your... your father just died?,Client,sadness,undefined
I appreciate your concern...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Were you close?,Client,sadness,undefined
"No, not really.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Why not?,Client,sadness,undefined
He left the family when...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
When I was young.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So was your mom at the funeral?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, my mom has been gone for a while.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
When?,Client,neutral,undefined
A long time ago.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Jesus.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So you've had it pretty rough, haven't you?",Client,sadness,undefined
I'm... I'm sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
We all have our fights to fight.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, look at you.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You deal with Daniel every day.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"God, why do you have to do that?",Client,anger,undefined
Do what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Turn everything around,Client,disgust,undefined
so that it's about me and my experience.,Client,disgust,undefined
Can't I just feel bad for you?,Client,disgust,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Go ahead.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So are you...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Feeling bad for me now?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yes.,Client,joy,undefined
We're having a whole conversation in my head.,Client,joy,undefined
"I have expressed my sympathies about your father, and you have",Client,joy,undefined
gratefully and graciously accepted my condolences.,Client,joy,undefined
Good.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You know, having a fantasy life as powerful as that...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
The ability to play out whole scenarios,Therapist,neutral,Approval
in your head... that's...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
That's the mark of a highly intelligent person.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Really?,Client,joy,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yes, according to some studies.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
And what do the other studies consider it a sign of?,Client,neutral,undefined
Utter insanity.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Can we go back to talking about your chemo session tomorrow?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Who can take you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
I understand you don't want to talk to your mother...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And I appreciate Leah can't take the stress...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Yeah. She's got midterms.,Client,depression,undefined
But you must have other friends who would like to be there.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I guess so.,Client,depression,undefined
What about Kyle?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"When you figure out who's gonna take you, will you let me know?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why?,Client,depression,undefined
I want to know that you've found somebody.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I'm sorry about your dad, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
Are you mad at me?,Client,neutral,undefined
Not at all.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
But I am concerned about you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Do you want to tell me why you ran away from school?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Bad day.,Client,depression,undefined
What happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can't I just sit here?,Client,depression,undefined
I just thought...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"you came here so early, you must have something that you want to talk about.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I told you...,Client,depression,undefined
my mom's still away and my dad's at work.,Client,depression,undefined
"But you've got keys to both their apartments,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and you came here.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you have any more ham?,Client,depression,undefined
You want me to make you another sandwich?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Is that okay?,Client,depression,undefined
Sure. I can do that.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"But I hope by now you understand that if there's something bothering you,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
you can talk to me about it.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Somebody put dog shit in my locker.,Client,anger,undefined
That's terrible.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
When was this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I came down from the roof at recess,Client,anger,undefined
to get my gloves out of my locker.,Client,anger,undefined
When I opened it there was dog,Client,anger,undefined
"dog shit everywhere, all over my backpack and all my stuff.",Client,anger,undefined
And all my stuff. I went back to the roof to tell my teacher.,Client,anger,undefined
What did she say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She got a janitor to clean it up.,Client,anger,undefined
"But recess was over, so everybody knew what happened.",Client,anger,undefined
Do you have any idea who was responsible?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"But nobody saw him,",Client,anger,undefined
so nothing's gonna happen to him.,Client,anger,undefined
"Yeah, well, I remember what he did to your shoes,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
so I guess this would be his next logical step.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
All through math everybody laughed about it.,Client,anger,undefined
The teacher got upset 'cause no one was paying attention.,Client,anger,undefined
That was my fault too.,Client,anger,undefined
"Listen, somebody did something awful to you.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"That is not your fault, okay?",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I asked my teacher if I could go to the bathroom.,Client,anger,undefined
But I went to the lobby instead.,Client,anger,undefined
"While the guard was talking to someone else, I snuck out.",Client,anger,undefined
You weren't kidding.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You had a hell of a day.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But I'm glad you came here so that we can talk about it.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
My dad's gonna be so mad.,Client,depression,undefined
And he's already really mad.,Client,depression,undefined
What's he mad about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Everything.,Client,depression,undefined
I've been staying with him for two weeks since mom went away.,Client,depression,undefined
"And he yells at me all the time, no matter what I do.",Client,depression,undefined
So What do you do when he yells at you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Let him yell.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you ever,Therapist,neutral,Open question
discuss the things you fight about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He doesn't talk to me unless he's yelling.,Client,depression,undefined
I think he broke up with Nina.,Client,depression,undefined
Did he tell you that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, but she doesn't come over anymore.",Client,depression,undefined
That's my fault too.,Client,depression,undefined
That can't be your fault.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Nina told my dad to make better rules for me.,Client,depression,undefined
And then they had this big fight.,Client,depression,undefined
Now she doesn't come over.,Client,depression,undefined
And when I see her at school she doesn't smile at me.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you miss her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not really.,Client,depression,undefined
But I think my dad does.,Client,depression,undefined
He did a really bad thing the day after the fight.,Client,depression,undefined
What did he do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I shouldn't tell you.,Client,depression,undefined
It's up to you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
He bought a six-pack of beer,Client,depression,undefined
and drank all of it and he fell asleep on the couch.,Client,depression,undefined
And what happened?,Client,depression,undefined
He didn't get up in time for work.,Client,depression,undefined
He yelled at me for that too.,Client,depression,undefined
Why didn't you wake me up?,Client,depression,undefined
But I didn't know I was supposed to do that.,Client,depression,undefined
There was no way you could've known what you were supposed to do.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
My mom was supposed to be back by now.,Client,depression,undefined
But she had to stay on her vacation an extra week.,Client,depression,undefined
Have you told her about the fights you've been having with your dad?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, she'll just get sad.",Client,depression,undefined
"If I were in your shoes, I'd be really upset about all that.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You know, oliver, I keep thinking you've sunk as low as you can go,",Client,anger,undefined
but it turns out there's no bottom.,Client,anger,undefined
Why don't we just sit down? We can talk about,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
what happened to oliver today.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I get out of my meeting...,Client,anger,undefined
I have seven messages from your school.,Client,anger,undefined
What the hell were you thinking to just disappear like that?,Client,anger,undefined
Eric dumped dog shit all in my locker.,Client,anger,undefined
He did what?,Client,anger,undefined
Apparently during recess today some kid vandalized oliver's locker.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Oliver's locker.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Nobody saw who did it. But all the kids knew that it had happened.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I hate that fucking place and I'm not going back.,Client,anger,undefined
Nobody told me that.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why didn't you ask me before you started yelling?,Client,anger,undefined
Because you still shouldn't just run off from school.,Client,anger,undefined
It's dangerous and you know better.,Client,anger,undefined
I think that what your dad is trying to say is,Therapist,neutral,Approval
that he understands that you've had a bad day.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And he's just concerned,Therapist,neutral,Approval
that you left school and you didn't tell anybody where you were going.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I don't want to talk about this anymore.,Client,anger,undefined
I understand.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Why don't you just go outside and I'll talk to your dad, okay?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Where were you last week?,Client,anger,undefined
I'm sorry I couldn't be here.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"First bess vanishes on this apparently permanent vacation,",Client,anger,undefined
and then you go awol.,Client,anger,undefined
It's like rats deserting a sinking ship.,Client,anger,undefined
"It was an emergency, luke.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's an emergency over here too.,Client,anger,undefined
Every day he comes up with a new way to drive me up the fucking wall.,Client,anger,undefined
So you've had a tough couple of weeks?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Bess calls every day. And we lie and tell her everything's fine.,Client,anger,undefined
And she sa she needs a little more time.,Client,anger,undefined
That must be pretty stressful on you and oliver.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
First he suddenly decides he won't do his homework.,Client,anger,undefined
He says he's taking a stand on principle...,Client,anger,undefined
the principle that school is stupid.,Client,anger,undefined
Have you talked to him about it,Therapist,neutral,Open question
or were you hoping I would say something?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I took away his tv privileges and his computer privileges,",Client,anger,undefined
but he still won't do his homework.,Client,anger,undefined
"You know, He just sits there and stares at the wall.",Client,anger,undefined
"He certainly knows how to push your buttons, doesn't he?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Next he decides to stop bathing.,Client,anger,undefined
What the hell am I supposed to do?,Client,anger,undefined
Climb into the shower with him and soap him down?,Client,anger,undefined
"I think Oliver feels powerless,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so he's refusing to follow the rules,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because that's the only way that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
he can get some control.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yesterday,",Client,anger,undefined
"after he left for school,",Client,anger,undefined
I went into his room and looked under his bed.,Client,anger,undefined
"Past the mountain of dirty clothes, there was all this food hidden in there.",Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, half-empty packages of oreos and doritos and cheetos.",Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, there was...",Client,anger,undefined
Did you tell Oliver what you'd found?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, and he got furious,",Client,anger,undefined
ran into his room and slammed the door.,Client,anger,undefined
"I should've gone in and talked to him, but I was so exhausted.",Client,anger,undefined
I understand that you'd be alarmed by all this.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But you know what? I've worked with a lot of kids,Therapist,neutral,Approval
in situations similar to Oliver's and...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
overeating is a pretty common response.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You know, this...",Client,depression,undefined
"This thing that happened at school today,",Client,depression,undefined
it isn't the first time.,Client,depression,undefined
Oliver gets bullied a lot.,Client,depression,undefined
Have you done anything about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Now that the school knows there's a problem,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
they're obligated to help you find a solution.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, now...",Client,depression,undefined
How are they gonna stop kids from picking on Oliver?,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, you see why it happens, right?",Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, he's fat,",Client,depression,undefined
"he's shy, he doesn't have any friends and he smells bad.",Client,depression,undefined
"If I were his age, I'd probably bully him too.",Client,depression,undefined
"Well, the way he's been...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"behaving lately, I can see how that would make you angry.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Sometimes I just wanna shake him,",Client,depression,undefined
"and say, if you keep acting like this, no one's ever gonna be your friend.",Client,depression,undefined
Is that what you want?,Client,depression,undefined
"That's unforgiveable, isn't it?",Client,depression,undefined
I think you wanna try and spare Oliver,Therapist,neutral,Approval
from the pain that he's going through right now.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But you love him so much,Therapist,neutral,Approval
and that makes you frustrated and angry.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, but what good is loving him if I can't help him?",Client,depression,undefined
But isn't loving him helping him?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I don't know anything about anything this week.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know anything about anything this week.,Client,depression,undefined
"So what else has been going on, Luke?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Looks like I'm single again.,Client,depression,undefined
Nina and I had a huge fight about Oliver.,Client,depression,undefined
And the reason I asked her out in the first place,Client,depression,undefined
is because she liked him.,Client,depression,undefined
I thought she'd be good with him.,Client,depression,undefined
But it turned out she just isn't on my side.,Client,depression,undefined
And whose side do you think she's on?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Last week Oliver dropped a carton of ice cream on the carpet.,Client,anger,undefined
Of course I got pissed off.,Client,anger,undefined
Then Nina came over and...,Client,anger,undefined
"for some stupid reason, I expected her to back me.",Client,anger,undefined
So you wanted her to help you,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
discipline Oliver.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"But instead, she started screaming at me.",Client,anger,undefined
"She said I wasn't spending enough time with Oliver him,",Client,anger,undefined
I wasn't setting clear boundaries for him.,Client,anger,undefined
And how did you respond to that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I told her if I wanted somebody yelling at me all the time,",Client,anger,undefined
I would've stayed married to Bess.,Client,anger,undefined
That went over real well.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, at first, Nina was a lot of fun.",Client,neutral,undefined
I could come home at the end of the day and just relax with her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Then, all of a sudden, she started",Client,anger,undefined
"scrutinizing my every move, marshalling evidence against me.",Client,anger,undefined
"I don't know, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
Why do I keep choosing these crazy women?,Client,anger,undefined
"I'm not so sure, Luke, that it's the women who are crazy.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think it's the position that you're putting them in.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So you're saying it's all my fault?,Client,neutral,undefined
"From what I've seen, you enjoy having fun with Oliver.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But when it comes to making the rules, creating a structure for him,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"for a long time, you let Bess do that job.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And then you hoped that Nina would take her place.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So when he misbehaves,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you blame them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You refuse to take responsibility for Oliver yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So can you see how that might...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
how that might upset everybody?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Boy, now I could really use a drink.",Client,anger,undefined
Have you been drinking lately?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What did Oliver tell you?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why would you ask me that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Because the night I broke up with Nina, I went out and got a six-pack,",Client,depression,undefined
"Because the night I broke up with Nina, I went out and got a six-pack,",Client,depression,undefined
drank the whole thing right in front of the kid.,Client,depression,undefined
"I thought, let him tell Nina,",Client,depression,undefined
"or Bess, or you.",Client,depression,undefined
Why not?,Client,depression,undefined
So you wanted Oliver to tell us?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't care.,Client,depression,undefined
I never really had a drinking problem. That was Bess being paranoid.,Client,depression,undefined
"But the other night, I'd just broken up with my girlfriend,",Client,depression,undefined
"my kid was acting up,",Client,depression,undefined
"my ex-wife skipped town, you'd skipped town.",Client,depression,undefined
"Shit, who wouldn't need a drink after all that, right?",Client,depression,undefined
Are you saying you needed a drink?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You know, the week before Bess went on vacation,",Client,depression,undefined
Oliver was on his best behavior.,Client,depression,undefined
"But the second she left town,",Client,depression,undefined
he's turned into this monster.,Client,anger,undefined
Is he trying to get some kind of reaction out of me?,Client,anger,undefined
I think that's part of it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I also think that he was behaving so well,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because he was trying to get some kind of reaction from you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That doesn't make any sense.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, look at it from Oliver's point of view.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"His family is breaking apart,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"so he puts a lot of pressure on himself,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"trying to behave perfectly,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
hoping that that would solve the problem.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So you're saying he was faking it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"In a way, yeah.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I mean, He even tried to stop eating so that you wouldn't be concerned about his weight.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He told you that?,Client,neutral,undefined
But it didn't work.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"He did everything right, but it didn't solve any of the problems.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So now, maybe he's behaving badly",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to try and make you feel as badly as he feels.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I tell you, I liked him a hell of a lot better when he was pretending to be happy.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, Oliver couldn't keep up that behavior forever.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He had me fooled.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Bess and I We talked to him about the adoption, and that seemed to make him feel better.",Client,neutral,undefined
I honestly believed he was doing well.,Client,neutral,undefined
Which is what I think he wanted you to believe.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I've talked to him about the adoption too, and...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"The way he sees it, Bess and you were fighting...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"too much, and you gave his brother away.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And things are so difficult for him right now that...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think that sometimes he wishes you'd give him away too.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Does he even love me?,Client,sadness,undefined
Why would you say that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I didn't love my dad.,Client,depression,undefined
Not even when you were Oliver's age?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sure.,Client,depression,undefined
"I did love him back then, but it was unrequited love.",Client,depression,undefined
"You'll have to explain that to me, Luke.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
My father was the dean of students and basketball coach at my middle school.,Client,depression,undefined
He was in charge of every breath my brother and I took.,Client,depression,undefined
"When we did well,",Client,depression,undefined
that's just what he expected of us.,Client,depression,undefined
"And when we screwed up,",Client,depression,undefined
"well, let's just say he was a man of limited sympathy.",Client,depression,undefined
That's quite a lot to live up to.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You'd think that.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The year I was in the seventh grade,",Client,neutral,undefined
he started taking long drives on the weekends by himself.,Client,neutral,undefined
"My brother and I got on our bikes and we rode around the neighborhood,",Client,joy,undefined
looking for his car.,Client,joy,undefined
And we found it in the driveway of this little house.,Client,neutral,undefined
My brother made me ring the buzzer.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The door opened, and there was my father's secretary,",Client,neutral,undefined
this nice lady who'd give us candy.,Client,joy,undefined
Then my dad came out of her bathroom and started screaming at us.,Client,depression,undefined
What did you guys do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What could we do? We got on our bikes and we rode home.,Client,depression,undefined
And then I was lying awake that night in the bed,Client,depression,undefined
and I realized my father's secretary's living room,Client,disgust,undefined
looked exactly like our living room.,Client,disgust,undefined
Every piece of furniture was exactly the same as ours.,Client,disgust,undefined
He must've bought it all for her.,Client,depression,undefined
My brother told my mother and shit hit the fan.,Client,disgust,undefined
She packed us up and we left town.,Client,depression,undefined
We only ever heard from him when he sent his check every month.,Client,depression,undefined
"He was good about the money, I'll give him that.",Client,disgust,undefined
But we didn't wanna see him.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, he sure didn't wanna see us.",Client,disgust,undefined
He never met Bess or Oliver.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And when he died, it was like a formality.",Client,disgust,undefined
But lately...,Client,depression,undefined
It's like he's laughing at me.,Client,depression,undefined
I did everything right.,Client,depression,undefined
I proposed to Bess when I got her pregnant.,Client,depression,undefined
I worked like a dog to make a good home.,Client,depression,undefined
I never raised a hand to Oliver.,Client,depression,undefined
And now I feel like I'm standing right where my father stood.,Client,sadness,undefined
"You know, just because you're getting a divorce, that doesn't...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that doesn't mean you're turning into your father.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it doesn't mean that you're gonna lose your son.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But that's exactly what it feels like I'm doing.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's inevitable that sometimes you'll remind yourself of your father.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You see how you wound your own children so...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so badly without even trying.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Suddenly, you almost understand how he...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
he could hurt you the way he did.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you don't have to become like him.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You're not doomed to live your father's life.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You have a choice.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I think our session is almost over.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Would you like to say anything to Oliver before you go?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Yeah, if we still have time.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not hungry. I don't need any pills. Leave me alone.,Client,anger,undefined
It's Paul.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
For Christ's sake. What are you doing here?,Client,neutral,undefined
You missed your session. I called your home.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Connie told me that you'd...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You'd been admitted last night.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
And she asked you to check in on me?,Client,disgust,undefined
I'd have come anyway.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I was worried about having to cancel my session last week, so...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, you can tell Connie you saw me and I sent you home.",Client,neutral,undefined
They're gonna be discharging me tomorrow.,Client,neutral,undefined
We'll have a session next week.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm not so sure they're gonna discharge you, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What are you talking about?,Client,neutral,undefined
You... You may not be ready to go home.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Of course I am. I had a little food poisoning.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
Food poisoning?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm glad to hear it.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Well, since you're fine,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"and I'm here, maybe we can... maybe we can talk.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Will it help get me out of here?,Client,disgust,undefined
It could.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Well, then tell me what you want to know.",Client,disgust,undefined
"First off,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
are they treating you well here?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, it's...",Client,neutral,undefined
"It's a little showy for a hospital,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but the staff's good. They're in and out all the time,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but no, I have no complaints.",Client,neutral,undefined
So I'll bet you'll be glad to get home.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I really miss my privacy, knowing where my things are.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Actually, I spoke with Connie.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
She told me that Natalie was leaving to fly back to Rwanda.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"You had an early dinner with both of them, she told me.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah, we ate in.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't go out. People gawk.,Client,neutral,undefined
And they both ate the same meal as you did?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Right. Chinese.,Client,neutral,undefined
But they didn't get food poisoning.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
So maybe I got a bug.,Client,neutral,undefined
I also talked to your attending physician.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He said that you were lucky.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Lucky?,Client,neutral,undefined
That Natalie's flight was canceled.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't follow you.,Client,neutral,undefined
She got a call from the airline while your wife was driving her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They turned around before they even got to the airport.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So that's what happened.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Another half hour, you wouldn't have made it.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I guess it wasn't my time.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Not now, please.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you want to tell me what really happened?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What's to tell?,Client,neutral,undefined
I kissed Natalie goodbye.,Client,neutral,undefined
I caught a chill after she left so I got back into bed.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When I woke up,",Client,neutral,undefined
I was here.,Client,neutral,undefined
Had you been spending a lot of time in bed?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't have anywhere else to be, do I?",Client,neutral,undefined
"And your daughter Natalie, how long has she been in New York?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"A week, 10 days.",Client,neutral,undefined
I told you Connie overreacted to my...,Client,neutral,undefined
"My forced retirement, sent out an S.O.S.",Client,neutral,undefined
sent out an S.O.S.,Client,neutral,undefined
The boys came in first from California.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how was that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Awkward as hell.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I didn't know how to talk to them, they didn't know how to talk to me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"We watched basketball,",Client,neutral,undefined
reruns.,Client,neutral,undefined
My older one ate my food.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The younger one was upset that there was no booze in the house,",Client,neutral,undefined
so he went out and got a bottle of single malt.,Client,neutral,undefined
After that I never saw him with an empty glass.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then,Client,neutral,undefined
Natalie came.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And the second she got in, they beat it the hell out of there.",Client,neutral,undefined
And she came all the way from Rwanda.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Paul, I know where she was living.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, but it's just that you'd said before that you felt that she was...",Client,neutral,undefined
done with you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, well, Connie must have really laid a guilt trip on her.",Client,neutral,undefined
And how was it seeing her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Uncomfortable.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She wanted to talk about what happened over there, what happened here.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I told her I wasn't in the mood for small talk,",Client,neutral,undefined
"she made me get out of bed and shower, shave,",Client,neutral,undefined
get dressed.,Client,neutral,undefined
Made me go out on walks in the park.,Client,neutral,undefined
She even took me to the zoo.,Client,neutral,undefined
She used to love going there when she was a little girl.,Client,neutral,undefined
So your mood improved when she was here.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did you find it,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
upsetting when she had to leave?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Well, of course I was upset, but I wanted her to go.",Client,neutral,undefined
"So whether or not you really were feeling better,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you made sure that they both thought you were.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I told you, I was better.",Client,anger,undefined
"So you had your last meal with Natalie, you kissed her goodbye,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
they left and you finally had...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Your privacy.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What I had was the chills.,Client,anger,undefined
And what did you take for the chills?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Aspirin.,Client,anger,undefined
Antacid.,Client,anger,undefined
What difference does it make?,Client,anger,undefined
"They pumped your stomach, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were pretty far gone.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it wasn't from antacids.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So what?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Probably what happened was I drifted off, woke up,",Client,neutral,undefined
reached out for the wrong pills in my sleep.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't believe you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What the fuck would you know?,Client,anger,undefined
Because it's my job to know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And I am obligated to express,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
my concern to Dr. Wells and the rest of the team here.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You don't have to be concerned, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
My family isn't going to sue you.,Client,anger,undefined
They're not like that pilot's family.,Client,anger,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That's all you're worried about, isn't it?",Client,neutral,undefined
I should have vetted you sooner.,Client,neutral,undefined
But someone on your school...,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm on the board, by the way, or was...",Client,neutral,undefined
"recommended you and, like I say,",Client,neutral,undefined
I've been dropping my guard lately.,Client,anger,undefined
I think you can still pack a pretty mean punch if you want to.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You seem like a smart fellow.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I know you wouldn't know anyone who could hurt me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But still,",Client,neutral,undefined
"when the leaks started to really hit the papers,",Client,neutral,undefined
I told Marie to have HR run a background check on you.,Client,neutral,undefined
What did you think about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You mean aside from wondering if you were in over your head with me?,Client,neutral,undefined
I had other things going.,Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't even look at it until last week.,Client,neutral,undefined
Last week...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
after I had to cancel.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Probably around there.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you feel I let you down by canceling?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, actually I was relieved.",Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't want to come in and go through the motions.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that what coming feels like?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
That's what everything feels like.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wasn't upset.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I was surprised.,Client,neutral,undefined
You convinced me,Client,neutral,undefined
that you were angry about what had happened to me,Client,neutral,undefined
and that you were on my side.,Client,neutral,undefined
And when I missed a session?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Boy, you really have a high opinion of yourself, don't you?",Client,neutral,undefined
I can't help but notice,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that's when you decided to read the background check.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I had time on my hands.,Client,neutral,undefined
And blood.,Client,neutral,undefined
Just like you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that,Therapist,neutral,Open question
also what you thought,Therapist,neutral,Open question
when you read about the lawsuit?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What difference does it make?,Client,anger,undefined
"You keep saying what difference does it make, but I think it does.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"With all due respect, Paul, don't flatter yourself.",Client,anger,undefined
If you'd been there or not it wouldn't have mattered one bit.,Client,anger,undefined
"So you're saying your mind was made up,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you would have done it anyway one way or the other.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Done what?,Client,anger,undefined
I went to sleep.,Client,anger,undefined
I went to sleep.,Client,anger,undefined
"What was it, a handful of pills?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
A couple of shots of your son's scotch?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It must have been everything you could do...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
To hold on,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
until Natalie was gone.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"What was she supposed to do, take care of me for the rest of my life?",Client,anger,undefined
"Both of them,",Client,anger,undefined
"opening the blinds, fluffing the fucking pillows,",Client,anger,undefined
making sure I'm dressed.,Client,anger,undefined
They were worrying themselves sick about me.,Client,anger,undefined
And you didn't want that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
So I...,Client,anger,undefined
I forced myself to start eating again. I stopped taking the pills.,Client,anger,undefined
I squirreled those away.,Client,anger,undefined
I pretended to sleep through the night just so they'd...,Client,anger,undefined
finally leave me alone for a few hours.,Client,anger,undefined
"A few hours, that's all you needed then?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I told Connie she couldn't let Natalie take a car service to the airport.,Client,anger,undefined
You figured she wouldn't just drop her off.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She'd wait at the airport for a while.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So you would have enough time.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I wanted Natalie up in the air,",Client,anger,undefined
as far away from this as possible.,Client,anger,undefined
Connie was just supposed to come home and find me asleep.,Client,anger,undefined
A millionaire's death.,Client,anger,undefined
You know what that means?,Client,anger,undefined
I think I heard my father use that expression.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, mine too.",Client,neutral,undefined
You go to bed one night,Client,depression,undefined
and you don't wake up.,Client,depression,undefined
Just close your eyes.,Client,depression,undefined
"I took the pills,",Client,depression,undefined
"chased them down,",Client,depression,undefined
took a few more.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't even remember the girls coming back.,Client,sadness,undefined
I must have vomited all over the bed.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I just wanted it to be over, that's all.",Client,sadness,undefined
"It's okay, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's okay.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I can't even do that.,Client,sadness,undefined
What do you mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Just leave it on the table. Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does everyone in the hospital know?,Client,neutral,undefined
You have a very good team of doctors.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
They assessed the situation the night that...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
you came in.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Is it in the papers?,Client,neutral,undefined
For how long?,Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't leave a note.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I left the TV on,",Client,neutral,undefined
left the lights on.,Client,neutral,undefined
Nobody was supposed to know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Just an old man...,Client,neutral,undefined
asleep under the covers.,Client,neutral,undefined
The doorman would have helped.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Short term,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Connie would have mourned, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
she has a support system.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Long term, she'd be a helluva lot better off",Client,neutral,undefined
as my widow than my wife.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm sure she would not agree with that, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
She didn't sign on for this.,Client,anger,undefined
For what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
To have a disgraced basket case as a husband.,Client,anger,undefined
Do you know what it's like for her?,Client,anger,undefined
She's been a C.E.O's wife and now she has to sneak out,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
through the service entrance of the building next door like...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Like you do.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's not the same. It's different for me.,Client,anger,undefined
And why is that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because she didn't do anything wrong.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And you did?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Everything that's happened to you,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
you feel that you've deserved it? Is that the way you think?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
People died...,Client,anger,undefined
People died...,Client,anger,undefined
"on my watch, Paul. Let's not pretend otherwise.",Client,anger,undefined
And anyone who's worried about you would be better off if you...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
weren't around?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's just... the objective truth.,Client,anger,undefined
You met my daughter?,Client,anger,undefined
She's got her whole life ahead of her.,Client,anger,undefined
Now what? She's supposed to just put it on hold and...,Client,anger,undefined
and worry about whether her old man,Client,anger,undefined
got out of bed that morning or took a shave?,Client,anger,undefined
I've met Natalie.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And she's in a terrifying place right now.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"But as hard as it is for her to worry about you,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I'm absolutely certain that if you'd managed to kill yourself,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
she would never have forgiven herself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The same way...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you've never forgiven yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's not the same.,Client,anger,undefined
Isn't it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You blamed yourself for Tommy's death,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
even though he was the one who jumped.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You blamed yourself for James,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
even though he was hell-bent on destruction.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you blamed yourself for this crisis,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
even though you did everything possible to avert it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"It wasn't enough, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Of course it wasn't. I mean, how could it be?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You've had...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"blood on your hands, as you say, your whole life.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it's shaped everything.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"That's why this time when kids died,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"it wasn't punishment enough to sacrifice your life to your parents,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
as you did.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
This time you had to impose the death penalty on yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I see what you're doing.,Client,anger,undefined
And what am I doing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is this how you deal with your guilt?,Client,anger,undefined
You tell yourself that what you feel isn't real?,Client,anger,undefined
That...,Client,anger,undefined
you did the best you could?,Client,anger,undefined
It's always there.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I always wonder what else I should have done,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
what the limits truly are of responsibility to another person.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And you can live with that?,Client,anger,undefined
It doesn't affect you?,Client,anger,undefined
Of course it does.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
All I can really do is try to...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
understand what happened and...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
why I made the choices I made.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
To... learn from the loss and to...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, it's different for you.",Client,anger,undefined
You're a young man.,Client,anger,undefined
"You can recover from your mistake,",Client,anger,undefined
"move to another state,",Client,anger,undefined
start over.,Client,anger,undefined
And you don't feel that you can?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's too late for me.,Client,anger,undefined
We both know that.,Client,anger,undefined
Look at you...,Client,anger,undefined
"One eye on the door,",Client,anger,undefined
wondering when you can get out of here and cut your losses.,Client,anger,undefined
That's not what I was doing.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Natalie is outside.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What is she still doing here? I told her to go home to her mother.,Client,anger,undefined
She doesn't listen to me anymore.,Client,anger,undefined
"She's on watch, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She doesn't trust that somebody is going to look in on you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
every 15 minutes or so.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Every 15 minutes?,Client,anger,undefined
Is that what that is?,Client,anger,undefined
You're at risk.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did you tell her that?,Client,anger,undefined
She told me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So?,Client,anger,undefined
Tell her I'm fine.,Client,anger,undefined
Tell her I'm fine.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You're safe to fly.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Whatever.,Client,anger,undefined
"I can't really do that, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think you're gonna have to stay here for a little longer.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
But I'm fine.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm eating. I'm sleeping.,Client,anger,undefined
I just got a little dehydrated.,Client,anger,undefined
Just tell them you're my therapist and that there's nothing wrong with me.,Client,anger,undefined
I can't do that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
In my opinion...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
you need to be kept under observation.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
And you've made it clear that you don't want your family standing guard duty.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Are you trying to have me committed?,Client,anger,undefined
What I'm saying is that I think it would be a very good idea for you,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
to stay here for a few days.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
This hospital is one of the best.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I'll call my lawyer.,Client,anger,undefined
He'll bounce you on your ass so fast you won't know what hit you.,Client,anger,undefined
"You want to sue me, Walter,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
get in line. But it's not gonna get you out of here any sooner.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How long?,Client,neutral,undefined
Until it's safe for you to leave.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"And if the doctors haven't released you within two weeks,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
then you have the right to make your case before a judge.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
A judge?,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you kidding me?,Client,neutral,undefined
I wish I were.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I don't want anything to happen to you, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Too late.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Walter, it's not too late.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
There's a lot...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Get out of here, will you?",Client,anger,undefined
Are you sure...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Just get out of here.,Client,anger,undefined
How are you?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I'm okay, thanks.",Client,neutral,undefined
Would you like some tea or some water?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Water'll be fine. Thanks.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thanks for the orchid that you sent. It was beautiful.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm glad you liked it.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I've been thinking about you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's a pity you weren't there.,Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't think it was my place to be there.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, well, it was a nice service...",Client,depression,undefined
Except for the priest's cell phone going off.,Client,depression,undefined
My kids spoke.,Client,depression,undefined
They each had...,Client,depression,undefined
a memory to tell.,Client,depression,undefined
And some people from the nursing home came.,Client,depression,undefined
They talked about his card playing and his singing.,Client,depression,undefined
Did he sing when you were a boy?,Client,depression,undefined
Not that I remember.,Client,depression,undefined
"But one of the surgical nurses said that,",Client,depression,undefined
"you know, he used to sing in the operating room.",Client,depression,undefined
"A fine Irish tenor, she said he was.",Client,depression,undefined
"Of course, there was a lot of women at the funeral.",Client,anger,undefined
"Women really liked my dad, as you know.",Client,anger,undefined
"Then too, women live longer than men",Client,anger,undefined
"so when you get to a certain age,",Client,anger,undefined
there are always going to be more women at funerals.,Client,anger,undefined
You know what I've decided? Women are really good at loss.,Client,anger,undefined
Men don't really... They haven't got a fucking clue.,Client,anger,undefined
Did you get to speak to your father before he died?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, for men loss is... It's a defeat.",Client,neutral,undefined
"In a game or a fight,",Client,neutral,undefined
losing makes you mad. You want to get even with the guy.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Like this man who's suing me, Alex's father.",Client,neutral,undefined
This guy is so angry,Client,neutral,undefined
that all he can think of is coming after me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Like that's gonna help.,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you trying to understand how to grieve for your father?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Among other things.,Client,neutral,undefined
What other things?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
One of the things I'm trying to understand,Client,anger,undefined
is how I can help my patients with death and dying,Client,anger,undefined
when I myself have been so stupid,Client,anger,undefined
and so wrong about it.,Client,anger,undefined
"You know, Paul, it hasn't even been two weeks.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You won't always feel this raw.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
We'll see.,Client,anger,undefined
Can you tell me more about the funeral?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I don't wanna talk about your patients now,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
when you've just been through this.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Do you not think it's important for me to talk about my patients?,Client,anger,undefined
How am I going to help my patients if my own life is in a mess?,Client,anger,undefined
Would you use a plumber if you found out,Client,anger,undefined
all the drains in his house were blocked?,Client,anger,undefined
It's not the same thing.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You're a trained psychotherapist.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But not a trained husband, father or son.",Client,anger,undefined
"No, you're not.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"As a man, you're like an animal in the wild.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You're living day to day,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
you're trying to protect your territory and provide for your family.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"As a therapist,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
you're observing certain members of the herd through binoculars.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
These are two very different ways of experiencing life.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But you can't observe yourself through your own binoculars.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But that's why I'm here.,Client,neutral,undefined
Right.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Can you tell me more about the funeral?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Not this week, please. I feel like...",Client,depression,undefined
I feel pretty wiped out.,Client,depression,undefined
We don't have to talk about it.,Client,depression,undefined
But I'm interested.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You said you were glad that your children were there.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, I was glad that the boys were there.",Client,anger,undefined
Maybe they won't be as stupid as I was about it all.,Client,anger,undefined
Stupid?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I learned more about my father at his funeral,Client,anger,undefined
than I ever did when he was alive.,Client,anger,undefined
Doesn't that sound stupid to you?,Client,anger,undefined
What did you learn about him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, for one thing,",Client,neutral,undefined
I found out that he did a lot of free surgery in Bolivia.,Client,neutral,undefined
You didn't know that about him?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, of course didn't.",Client,neutral,undefined
And he made me executor of his estate.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does that surprise you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And he gave me his half of a little brewery in Minnesota.,Client,neutral,undefined
He owned a brewery in Minnesota?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
With one of his doctor friends. I guess he loaned some guy,Client,neutral,undefined
some start-up money 40 years ago.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So if the lawsuit ends up costing me my license,",Client,neutral,undefined
I guess I can always go make beer.,Client,neutral,undefined
You see what I'm talking about?,Client,neutral,undefined
Who was this man?,Client,neutral,undefined
All I knew was this old story that I've told you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"That he left us for a patient, my mother killed herself and I grew up alone.",Client,neutral,undefined
All these things are still true?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How the fuck would I know?,Client,anger,undefined
"If my father was this great guy,",Client,anger,undefined
why didn't I know it?,Client,anger,undefined
Are you beginning to think he was a great guy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Even if he wasn't great, at least he was interesting.",Client,anger,undefined
But what was I? Was I blind?,Client,anger,undefined
People often can be very successful in the outside world,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and remain a complete mystery to their families.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Mystery is putting it mildly, Gina.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I don't think he was a complete mystery to you, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I think as a boy, even though you didn't have all the facts,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
you knew he was an interesting man.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That's why you were mad that he was never home.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you wanted to live with him instead of your mother.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, who wouldn't?",Client,neutral,undefined
It wasn't your choice.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Paul, he was the only one with a choice in your family.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"He chose his work, his investments,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
his women.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That hurt you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I wasn't hurt. I just hated the son of a bitch.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think the hatred grew,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
so you could protect yourself from his rejection.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't think you always hated him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You think I loved him?,Client,anger,undefined
I'm saying it wasn't stupid of you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
not to know about these things.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I mean, maybe he didn't want to call attention to his charity work.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Or maybe he thought his singing was silly or the brewery was frivolous.,Client,anger,undefined
Or maybe he wasn't home enough to have any conversation about anything,Client,anger,undefined
"or maybe by the time he got ready to talk, I didn't give a shit.",Client,anger,undefined
All these things are possible.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Death leaves a lot of unanswered questions.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know, not everybody has what it takes to be a good parent.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And sometimes, as in your father's case,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the choices can be very difficult.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you give yourself over to your sick wife and angry children,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and fight a losing battle?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Or do you give yourself,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to your talent and hope that someday they'll understand?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So you're saying his home life was a losing battle for him?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm saying that he looked at his options,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and he fought the battle he thought he could win.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
A less charitable view would be that he won the battle he chose to fight.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's true.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
So it wasn't stupid of me to not know who my father was when I was a boy.,Client,neutral,undefined
It was stupid that I got,Client,anger,undefined
to be this old and still didn't know who he was.,Client,anger,undefined
Even sitting there at the bedside in the nursing home...,Client,depression,undefined
He had maybe five minutes to live.,Client,depression,undefined
And for the first time it was just me and him together.,Client,depression,undefined
"Sickness until death, and all that.",Client,depression,undefined
The only person,Client,depression,undefined
I learned anything about was me.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm glad you saw him before he died.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"It was the strangest thing, you know?",Client,depression,undefined
Everybody left and...,Client,depression,undefined
I went downstairs and said goodbye to them...,Client,depression,undefined
Got a coffee and I came back and he was...,Client,depression,undefined
He was asleep.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, he had a pulse anyway.",Client,depression,undefined
And I sat down and I started talking to him and...,Client,depression,undefined
And he didn't have a pulse anymore.,Client,depression,undefined
You were talking to him when he died?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I was talking at him, Gina.",Client,depression,undefined
I said...,Client,depression,undefined
I'm sorry and...,Client,depression,undefined
I said I was sorry that I hadn't seen more of him.,Client,depression,undefined
I asked him if I could get him anything and...,Client,depression,undefined
Then I just started complaining about my life...,Client,depression,undefined
Like I always do.,Client,depression,undefined
I looked up and he was...,Client,sadness,undefined
He was gone.,Client,sadness,undefined
Did it feel to you like he'd been waiting for you to come back,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
to see him before he died?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"No. That's what the nurses say, but...",Client,depression,undefined
"No. That's what the nurses say, but...",Client,depression,undefined
"They say it happens a lot, but I don't believe it.",Client,depression,undefined
I think it's crazy.,Client,depression,undefined
"No, not really.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
On some unconscious level he might have known it was you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Or sensed it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, he didn't.",Client,depression,undefined
Didn't you ever become suddenly aware,Therapist,neutral,Open question
of your children without them having said anything?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"With Max, I remember when he used to wake up in the middle of the night,",Client,neutral,undefined
he would come into my room and I would just wake up.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And there he would be standing at the end of the bed, just...",Client,neutral,undefined
staring silently at me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So even though Max hadn't said a thing, you woke up.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, great.",Client,anger,undefined
So my father becomes aware of me on some level,Client,anger,undefined
and he really doesn't want to listen to me complain so he just dies.,Client,anger,undefined
"Or he becomes aware of you on some level,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and he's finally able to let go.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'd like to believe your version.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you believe it?,Client,neutral,undefined
Or are you just saying it to make me feel better?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do I believe that there's some non-scientific connection,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
between a parent and child?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Absolutely.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Does that mean that a parent knows what a child needs?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, it just means there's a connection.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, we're more than connected.",Client,depression,undefined
There's obligations between parents and children.,Client,depression,undefined
There are things that they owe us and there are things that we owe them.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yes, but, you know, I think obligation is maybe a subject for another day.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"No, I want to talk about obligation today.",Client,depression,undefined
My father owed me things...,Client,depression,undefined
And he didn't come through for me.,Client,depression,undefined
And I owed him things and I didn't come through for him.,Client,depression,undefined
If I'm not gonna do any better by my kids,Client,depression,undefined
"and they're not gonna come and see me till I'm about to die,",Client,depression,undefined
then we are all hopelessly screwed.,Client,depression,undefined
Is that your father's watch?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You don't want to talk about this?,Client,depression,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't want to talk about anything in general.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't want to talk about obligations or family duty.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I want to talk about you and your father.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
This is his watch.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm gonna wear it for a bit.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't usually wear watches.,Client,depression,undefined
But I'll wear this for a while.,Client,depression,undefined
Because it's a pathetic excuse for...,Client,depression,undefined
For grieving.,Client,depression,undefined
There it is.,Client,depression,undefined
What did you mean when you said,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
the only person you learned anything about that day was you?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I felt like I was in a movie I was watching.,Client,depression,undefined
I felt like I was in a movie I was watching.,Client,depression,undefined
"Self-centered guy goes to the hospital to see his dying father,",Client,depression,undefined
"sits down, can't think of anything to say to his dad.",Client,depression,undefined
Then he starts whining about his own little problems.,Client,depression,undefined
"A divorce, the fear of losing touch with his children,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"a move to a new city, the threat to the man's work from a lawsuit.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
They don't sound so little when you actually say them.,Client,depression,undefined
These are big problems to somebody in the middle of their life.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"But to someone confronting death, like the father,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
it might seem that the son could work these problems out.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"The dying father doesn't have the time, but the son does.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"No marriage, no children,",Client,depression,undefined
"no practice, just time.",Client,depression,undefined
"Without the time, you don't have any of the other things.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I guess.,Client,depression,undefined
"No, it's not a guess. It's true.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Time's the precious thing. You already know that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's why you're wearing his watch.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you were telling him your problems,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because you were hoping he'd say something meaningful to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Or finally be a father to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
But after he was gone I wished the whining guy in the movie,Client,depression,undefined
could have been some kind of comfort to his father.,Client,depression,undefined
I wished I had...,Client,depression,undefined
done or said something more than just take the man's watch.,Client,depression,undefined
Is there anything you wished you had asked him before he was gone?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I wanted to ask him if...,Client,depression,undefined
If he was proud of me.,Client,depression,undefined
But you know he was.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Do I?,Client,depression,undefined
You're a good doctor to your patients.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You're a good father to your children.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And you love singing.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I'm a terrible singer, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't say you were a good singer.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I said you liked singing.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I should have gone earlier.,Client,depression,undefined
I know that.,Client,depression,undefined
Guess I was afraid.,Client,fear,undefined
"Once I was there I thought, What the hell was I afraid of?",Client,fear,undefined
My father is dying. What can he possibly do to me?,Client,fear,undefined
Do you know what you were afraid of?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I was afraid that after a lifetime of hating him...,Client,fear,undefined
He was gonna love me anyway.,Client,fear,undefined
And I think,Client,fear,undefined
I waited till he couldn't talk anymore because...,Client,fear,undefined
I just didn't want to hear him say it.,Client,fear,undefined
Why would that have been so bad?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because if he could love me,Client,depression,undefined
and not give me one minute of his time...,Client,depression,undefined
Then love doesn't mean a thing and I don't want it.,Client,depression,undefined
You can't intellectualize it.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"It's something we feel,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"sometimes with good reason, sometimes not.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"You know, I was a pallbearer",Client,depression,undefined
and... so was Ian.,Client,depression,undefined
And as we came out of the church,Client,depression,undefined
"and carried the coffin to the churchyard,",Client,depression,undefined
"I looked over at him and I thought,",Client,depression,undefined
One day he's gonna carry me...,Client,depression,undefined
If I'm lucky enough not to mess it up.,Client,depression,undefined
You won't mess it up.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
How can you be so sure?,Client,depression,undefined
Because you already know,Therapist,neutral,Approval
that love is the only thing that has a chance against death.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"It causes us a lot of pain, but without it,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"we feel isolated, untethered, lost in space.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
So...,Client,depression,undefined
My father...,Client,depression,undefined
loved me.,Client,depression,undefined
And he did what he could.,Client,depression,undefined
No. Your father loved you and he did what he did.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you loved him and you hated him because he ignored you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's not pretty.,Client,depression,undefined
Is it?,Client,depression,undefined
I wish you could have had the father you deserved.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But maybe you can be a father to yourself now,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and do for yourself what you do for your boys.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Did you have the father that you needed?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm a therapist! What do you think?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I gotta go.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've got to meet,Client,neutral,undefined
Alex's father.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe there's some way I can help.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Thank you, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Hello, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Would you like to come in?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's over.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not pregnant.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not feeling well.,Client,depression,undefined
I really should've stayed home.,Client,depression,undefined
I called in sick at work. That's a first.,Client,depression,undefined
What did your doctor say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'll live.,Client,depression,undefined
Did he say anything else?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm so tired.,Client,depression,undefined
I want to go back to bed.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not up for a whole session.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, why don't we just start and then",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
we'll see how it... how it goes?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I'd rather stay here for now.,Client,depression,undefined
Can I get you a glass of water?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Maybe some tea?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"That's very nice, but I'm fine.",Client,depression,undefined
That's what you kept saying last week... I'm fine.,Client,depression,undefined
How have you been?,Client,depression,undefined
Fine.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Would you like to tell me what happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
There's not much to tell.,Client,depression,undefined
I went to work on friday...,Client,depression,undefined
Started bleeding.,Client,depression,undefined
I went home...,Client,depression,undefined
And it didn't stop.,Client,depression,undefined
End of story.,Client,depression,undefined
"So,",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"emotionally, how are you?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I'm kind of numb.,Client,depression,undefined
It feels better that way.,Client,depression,undefined
I understand.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I thought,Client,depression,undefined
that I was gonna be a parent and now I know,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm really sorry, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I just felt transformed for a couple of weeks.,Client,depression,undefined
Like I had a real...,Client,depression,undefined
purpose. And I was a different...,Client,depression,undefined
a different me.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, a woman has a baby",Client,depression,undefined
and people stop asking questions: what's wrong with her?,Client,depression,undefined
Or...,Client,depression,undefined
she's so ambitious.,Client,depression,undefined
Or pathetic or strange.,Client,depression,undefined
It's easy then... she's a mother.,Client,depression,undefined
It answers all the questions.,Client,depression,undefined
It seems to me that you had a lot of questions yourself last week.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Maybe I melted down a little, but I still wanted to have the baby.",Client,depression,undefined
The stupid thing is I can smoke now - and I don't even want to.,Client,depression,undefined
So maybe you have changed a little.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Nice try.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
There's other ways to be a parent,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
if that's what you really want.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You mean compete,Client,depression,undefined
with some young suburban couple for some pregnant teen's baby?,Client,depression,undefined
I can't imagine picking,Client,depression,undefined
ivy league sperm out of a catalogue,Client,depression,undefined
to defrost and squirt.,Client,depression,undefined
"You don't want to adopt,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you don't want a donor,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and yet you're sure that you wanted a baby.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"It isn't just about being a mother,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
like you said last week. You also wanted to have,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
the perfect picture.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I kept waiting to meet the right guy but it...,Client,depression,undefined
he didn't show up.,Client,depression,undefined
Or more likely,Client,depression,undefined
I pushed him away.,Client,depression,undefined
And now no man and no kid.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't want to talk about this.,Client,depression,undefined
Let's switch to the weather.,Client,depression,undefined
"It was a really cold weekend, wasn't it?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Actually, it was surprisingly warm.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Did you stay inside?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you call anybody?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You could've called me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're still in mourning,Client,sadness,undefined
"and you were away over the weekend anyway, right?",Client,sadness,undefined
"Mia, something like this...",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
you call me.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Actually, I did talk to someone. Believe it or not,",Client,depression,undefined
I spoke to my mother.,Client,depression,undefined
I'd certainly like to hear about that.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think we could talk about it inside?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What is it with therapists?,Client,neutral,undefined
You hear the word mother and these bells go off?,Client,neutral,undefined
Pretty much.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's... it's part of the training.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So would you like to tell me about the conversation,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
you had with your mother?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Cara, one of my nieces, gave a piano recital on saturday,",Client,depression,undefined
"Cara, one of my nieces, gave a piano recital on saturday,",Client,depression,undefined
and when my mother saw that I wasn't there,Client,depression,undefined
she called to see if I was okay.,Client,depression,undefined
Your mother and,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
not your father?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Right.,Client,depression,undefined
I haven't heard from him in a while.,Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, my mother is the queen of protocol",Client,depression,undefined
and I had missed a family event.,Client,depression,undefined
"This... it was Cara playing Chopin, and I have been paying for her lessons.",Client,depression,undefined
I told my sisters that if any of the girls wanted,Client,depression,undefined
music lessons that I would treat.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, what is the money for?",Client,depression,undefined
I defend some pretty questionable doctors,Client,depression,undefined
present company excluded...,Client,depression,undefined
and how many pairs of high heels do I need?,Client,depression,undefined
Is that because you want to make sure that music isn't taken away from them,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
in the way,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that it was for you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Playing piano was...,Client,depression,undefined
the one thing that always made me feel happy.,Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, I didn't answer the phone, so she left a message.",Client,depression,undefined
And then later that afternoon she showed up at my apartment,Client,depression,undefined
with a platter of pierogis.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe she was concerned for you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, there's always a first time, right?",Client,depression,undefined
So how did it go?,Client,depression,undefined
I was still in my pyjamas.,Client,depression,undefined
"She took one look at me, the heating pad, the tylenol,",Client,depression,undefined
"the tissues in front of me and she said, do you have the flu?",Client,depression,undefined
And I shook my head no.,Client,depression,undefined
I started to cry and she got it.,Client,depression,undefined
And she said maybe that's nature's way.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know when I last cried in front of her,Client,depression,undefined
or when she's last,Client,depression,undefined
hugged me.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then she heated up the food,",Client,depression,undefined
"set the table nicely, poured us some nalewka.",Client,depression,undefined
What's that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's a cherry-infused vodka. It's a traditional drink.,Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, she tried to make a consolation toast.",Client,depression,undefined
She said to better days...,Client,depression,undefined
And then she told me,Client,depression,undefined
that she was proud of me.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, maybe she was.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
She said that I should be,Client,depression,undefined
grateful for what I have.,Client,depression,undefined
"My independence, my career, this interesting life I'm leading.",Client,depression,undefined
It sounds like some of the things that she might have wanted,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for herself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I snapped at her. I said, that's kind of a strange toast",Client,anger,undefined
considering you've always blamed me for ruing your modeling career.,Client,anger,undefined
Did you tell her that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, you won't believe what she said.",Client,depression,undefined
She said that,Client,depression,undefined
she didn't really have much of a career.,Client,depression,undefined
She wasn't that pretty and,Client,depression,undefined
that she never would have risen above her,Client,depression,undefined
"job as an underwear model,",Client,depression,undefined
which is not what I grew up hearing.,Client,depression,undefined
"Right, her mantra.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Her false mantra.,Client,anger,undefined
"The same lie over and over until everyone accepts that it's true,",Client,anger,undefined
"especially me, the one that she loves to blame.",Client,anger,undefined
Did you ask her why she did that?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
My mother said that it was...,Client,depression,undefined
Kind of her cover story...,Client,depression,undefined
That having me didn't ruin her looks. It,Client,depression,undefined
destroyed,Client,depression,undefined
her mind.,Client,depression,undefined
"She said that after I was born, she lost it.",Client,depression,undefined
"She couldn't get out of bed, she didn't want to eat.",Client,depression,undefined
She said she stayed in her room because she was afraid,Client,depression,undefined
"that if she left it, she would kill herself,",Client,depression,undefined
and that there was,Client,depression,undefined
"some small, sane part of her that didn't want to do that to me.",Client,depression,undefined
You know there are some mothers who get so depressed,Therapist,neutral,Approval
that they lose sight of even that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
So where was your father during all of this?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
She said he just moved into the living room.,Client,neutral,undefined
He didn't try to get her professional help?,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you kidding?,Client,neutral,undefined
He was first generation.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He would've been mortified to ask someone for help,",Client,neutral,undefined
to admit that his wife was crazy.,Client,neutral,undefined
So he took care of you during this time?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He did everything. He had too.,Client,neutral,undefined
She didn't even want to breastfeed.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So, really, you weren't",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
mothered for over,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
a year.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"When she came out of it somehow she did, she said",Client,depression,undefined
she had this rush of feeling,Client,depression,undefined
"and that she wanted to be close to me,",Client,depression,undefined
but by then my dad and I were just inseparable...,Client,depression,undefined
I think the word she used was,Client,depression,undefined
impenetrable,Client,depression,undefined
that my father had never forgiven her and that,Client,depression,undefined
he used our closeness to show her how,Client,depression,undefined
she'd failed.,Client,depression,undefined
She said that she was so guilt-ridden that she thought,Client,depression,undefined
"she didn't deserve me, and so she just",Client,depression,undefined
kept away.,Client,depression,undefined
That's quite an admission.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That must've given you a lot to,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
take in about,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
both your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, I guess.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think her depression might also explain,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
why she didn't get pregnant again for 10 years?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
No. She talked about that too. The twins,Client,depression,undefined
the cherished twins,Client,depression,undefined
they were an accident.,Client,depression,undefined
She said that,Client,depression,undefined
she was terrified when she found out that she was pregnant again,Client,depression,undefined
and that she asked my father,Client,depression,undefined
to hire a sitter so,Client,depression,undefined
someone would take care of us if she couldn't.,Client,depression,undefined
"And according to her, he said",Client,depression,undefined
no.,Client,depression,undefined
That he couldn't afford it. And she insisted that it was,Client,depression,undefined
his idea to send me out to his sister's out in new jersey.,Client,depression,undefined
And you don't believe her?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Of course not.,Client,depression,undefined
My father adored me.,Client,depression,undefined
"She also said that I was wrong about him coming out to visit me every sunday,",Client,depression,undefined
"that I must've made that up, because they came together",Client,depression,undefined
once a month.,Client,depression,undefined
That's not possible.,Client,depression,undefined
"Actually, mia, it is...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because it's entirely possible you airbrushed her,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
out of your memories of that time.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Sometimes the need to protect one parent,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is so strong a child puts all the blame on the other.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, you're getting this wrong.",Client,depression,undefined
"She, she is the one who blamed me.",Client,depression,undefined
"Until saturday,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
when she came to you with what sounds like,Therapist,neutral,Open question
an unburdening.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm wondering what that must've been like for you to hear.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It made me furious,Client,anger,undefined
"and if I hadn't been sick, I would have thrown her out.",Client,anger,undefined
Do you know what it was that made you so angry?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
She spent my whole life telling me,Client,anger,undefined
"that I ruined her life, and now she changes her mind",Client,anger,undefined
She spent my whole life telling me,Client,anger,undefined
"that I ruined her life, and now she changes her mind",Client,anger,undefined
"when I'm vulnerable, when I've cried in her arms.",Client,anger,undefined
"Well, maybe feeling you cry in her arms is what made her open up.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What kind of timing is that? What does she expect?,Client,anger,undefined
That's a good question. What do you think she expected?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Why are we examining her motives?,Client,anger,undefined
I'm fucking here because of her fucked-up motives.,Client,anger,undefined
She wanted me to let her off the hook.,Client,anger,undefined
"Bless me, my daughter, for I have sinned.",Client,anger,undefined
I'm supposed to listen until she's finished and grant absolution?,Client,anger,undefined
"What's the matter? You look horrified. What, I'm back to monster Mia here?",Client,anger,undefined
"No no no no no, I understand your anger.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"She didn't take care of you, she lied, she was never there for you,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
then suddenly she wants to be,Therapist,neutral,Approval
close.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Why...,Client,depression,undefined
Did she give up?,Client,depression,undefined
"Okay, she was sick for a year,",Client,depression,undefined
but after that...,Client,depression,undefined
Why didn't she fight harder to be my mother?,Client,depression,undefined
"How, how come nobody sticks by me?",Client,depression,undefined
But she did say that she tried but that there was something,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
impenetrable about your father's bond with you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Why are you taking her side?,Client,anger,undefined
I'm not trying to take her side.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
All I'm suggesting is that,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
it may not be as black and white as you rember it.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's black and black.,Client,anger,undefined
She manipulated me one way,Client,anger,undefined
for my entire life and now she wants to manipulate me the other way,Client,anger,undefined
to get rid of her guilt.,Client,anger,undefined
"That might be true,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"but it's also possible, perhaps in her own",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"clumsy way, that your mother was trying to reach out.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"She saw that you were in cris, in some way like her own crisis...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"there you were in pajamas, you were depressed,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
it was related to a pregnancy and she recognized it right away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She was trying to help.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So once again,",Client,anger,undefined
I had a chance at,Client,anger,undefined
intimacy and I screwed it up.,Client,anger,undefined
I pushed her away. Is that your point?,Client,anger,undefined
God damn it.,Client,anger,undefined
Just stop all the therapy and tell me what you think.,Client,anger,undefined
Your mother tells you all these things and you get angry.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What about your father?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I felt bad for him.,Client,anger,undefined
"His wife gives birth,",Client,anger,undefined
he wants to celebrate and she's ready to jump out the window?,Client,anger,undefined
"Plus he has a crying, hungry infant to take care of.",Client,anger,undefined
"He has to be both the mother and the father, so good for him.",Client,anger,undefined
Has it ever occurred to you he might have colluded in the lie that she told?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You just said it: she told the lie.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But he never corrected it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Why do you think that is, Mia?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
He was helping her save face.,Client,neutral,undefined
For 43 years?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can't you accept that he was a good father?,Client,anger,undefined
Nobody in therapy has a good dad?,Client,anger,undefined
A good dad who shipped a 10-year-old girl off to New Jersey,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
rather than pay for a babysitter?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
There had to be a way to keep you at home.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I mean, families find a way of working things out.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, she's probably lying about all that too.",Client,neutral,undefined
"She could be, but let's just take her at her word for a moment.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What that means is that you have to reevaluate,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
who your parents are and what they did.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe your father wasn't the ideal man that you thought.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And maybe your mother was actually trying to connect with you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What's going on here? She decides to rewrite history,Client,anger,undefined
and you just go along with it?,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, sometimes we find it easier",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
to hold on to the fiction.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"It's not fiction, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
I'm telling you my mother was never there for me,Client,anger,undefined
and my father always was.,Client,anger,undefined
"That's your mantra, Mia,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and maybe it's as false as your mother's.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Look at the way you defend it, how angry you get if I challenge it.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I ask you to see your parents in a different light...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I just ask you to do that... and you go on the attack.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You accuse me of taking sides.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe I just don't like it when you blame him for everything.,Client,anger,undefined
I need a break.,Client,anger,undefined
Shit.,Client,anger,undefined
Sorry.,Client,anger,undefined
That's okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"It's not about blame, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What I'm asking you to do is more complex than that.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I want you to question the way that you have thought about your parents,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
for most of your life.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Oh, is that all?",Client,anger,undefined
"I know it isn't easy, but I can tell you from personal experience...",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
It's better to do it when your parents are still alive.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
My whole life I had this...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Distorted image of,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
who my parents were.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And I didn't want to let that go.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I fought against it, and then finally I did,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and it was too late.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
My father was...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
he was gone.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And that was...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
a huge loss.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I've had enough loss this week.,Client,depression,undefined
"I know, but, Mia, if you don't go through this,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"you're gonna stay where you are,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
you're gonna keep punishing the men in your life for not being what you need...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
men like Bennett.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Bennett was an asshole.,Client,neutral,undefined
Or like me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You blamed me for the abortion,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
but wasn't it your father who arranged it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He was just supporting me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Or maybe he was, once again, trying to hold on",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"too tight, to keep you as his little girl.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
No.,Client,anger,undefined
"No, the abortion was my idea.",Client,anger,undefined
I told you that last week.,Client,anger,undefined
"You said you haven't heard from him lately,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
even though he must've known you were sick.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He was... he was always there when I was a girl.,Client,depression,undefined
Was he?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How about your piano?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You said it was the one thing that always made you happy.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Did you mother talk about what happened to it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She said that he sold it.,Client,neutral,undefined
He said with two babies in the house there was enough noise.,Client,depression,undefined
Let me ask you something: what would happen,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
if you believed her?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
If you actually let yourself feel the hurt and the anger,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
that you might have buried for this perfect dad?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"I can't do this, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
"Okay? Not today, not this week.",Client,anger,undefined
"You know, maybe this is the perfect time.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
This is a week that's been filled with loss.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You mother comes and she gives you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
A new family history.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The picture you've had of them is just torn up and thrown away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And earlier in the week you lost your own child,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the baby that you wanted for so long.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That new family also just taken away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's not quite true.,Client,depression,undefined
"On saturday my mother insisted on calling her doctor,",Client,depression,undefined
and he had us meet him at his office in greenpoint,Client,depression,undefined
on a saturday night.,Client,depression,undefined
He's the same doctor who delivered the twins.,Client,depression,undefined
Hadn't you already seen your doctor?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I called on friday.,Client,depression,undefined
"My park avenue obgyn said, you know,",Client,depression,undefined
wait it out and to call him if the pain got much worse.,Client,depression,undefined
"My mom drove us to brooklyn and there was old dr. Solomon,",Client,depression,undefined
sitting behind his desk.,Client,depression,undefined
He did some tests,Client,depression,undefined
and he told me that...,Client,depression,undefined
that I hadn't lost the baby because I wasn't ever pregnant.,Client,depression,undefined
I told him about my f. s. h. level,Client,depression,undefined
and he said that I probably never would be pregnant.,Client,depression,undefined
And then he went on. He said that...,Client,depression,undefined
He sees this kind of thing once a week:,Client,depression,undefined
"women like me... successful,",Client,depression,undefined
"no children, my age and older...",Client,depression,undefined
who come in just convinced that they're pregnant.,Client,depression,undefined
And he has to tell them that they're...,Client,depression,undefined
they're not.,Client,depression,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So you hadn't done a test before that.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
No.,Client,sadness,undefined
why not?,Client,sadness,undefined
I don't know.,Client,sadness,undefined
I thought I would wait.,Client,sadness,undefined
I had an appointment for this week,Client,sadness,undefined
to see my doctor and I was just so sure.,Client,sadness,undefined
But I had it wrong and you have it wrong.,Client,sadness,undefined
I don't have to grieve for a child that I never had.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Mia, last week you...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you talked about the... the new life that...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that you felt inside you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement

The strength of that desire to...,Client,sadness,undefined
to create new life.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's almost 7:45.,Client,sadness,undefined
Is it too early to get drunk?,Client,sadness,undefined
Who knows? I could get lucky and...,Client,sadness,undefined
meet another married man at the bar.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm gonna go.,Client,sadness,undefined
Will you please call me during the week?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Call you?,Client,sadness,undefined
I want to know how you are.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

Fine. How was yours?,Client,depression,undefined
It was okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How are you feeling about your dad?,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Client,depression,undefined
I'd rather talk about you.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Surprise sur-fucking-prise.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm just worried that what happened last weekend,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
may have changed our relationship.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
We have no relationship.,Client,depression,undefined
I've dumped people for less than what you did to me.,Client,anger,undefined
Are you thinking of dumping me ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know what I'm doing here ?,Client,anger,undefined
Maybe you wanted to convey your anger toward me in person.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe I just wanted to get out of the hospital for a few hours.,Client,anger,undefined
Does anybody know that you left ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You think I just hopped a fence or something ?,Client,anger,undefined
Call the doctors if you like ; you're all such good friends now.,Client,anger,undefined
"I'm doing fine, so they let me out for a few hours...",Client,neutral,undefined
I have to check back in tonight.,Client,neutral,undefined
I had to tell her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why ?,Client,anger,undefined
She's your mother and you were delirious.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You could've waited until I came out of it.,Client,anger,undefined
And what if you never came out of it ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Then someone would've called her eventually.,Client,anger,undefined
You put me down as your emergency contact number.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So ?,Client,anger,undefined
So you empowered me to make a decision on your behalf.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
If anything happened to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I had a bad fever. It wasn't like I was in heart failure.,Client,anger,undefined
You had 105. They were packing ice onto you when I arrived.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I talked to the doctors Paul. I know what happened.,Client,anger,undefined
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I understand that you're angry with me.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But I didn't make this decision lightly.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"And if I had to to it again, I would do exactly the same thing.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Has my insurance covered everything?,Client,anger,undefined
You don't have to worry about that.,Client,anger,undefined

"April, please don't go.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
the one thing - that I asked you not to do.,Client,anger,undefined

on the brink of death.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You really don't understand do you ?,Client,anger,undefined

so we could discuss it in person.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But she...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
she refused.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
She's paranoid.,Client,anger,undefined
"I offered to go to her house, she hung up,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and I called her back.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I asked her if she'd meet me at the hospital in an hour.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
She showed up ?,Client,anger,undefined
Are you surprised ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you meet her in my room ?,Client,anger,undefined
No. In the lobby.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How did you recognize each other ?,Client,anger,undefined
She looks just like you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So you just...,Client,anger,undefined
"walked up to her and said : Hi, I'm Paul Weston,",Client,anger,undefined
your daughter is stage three non-Hodgkins lymphoma and,Client,anger,undefined
she's dying on the fourth floor.,Client,anger,undefined

stunned.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Did she cry ?,Client,neutral,undefined
Was she angry at me ?,Client,neutral,undefined
Definitely not.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
She hates being the last person to find something out.,Client,depression,undefined
She did have a hard time believing,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
you would keep something like this from her.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What did you say to that ?,Client,neutral,undefined
I told her she'd have to speak to you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
How long was this conversation ?,Client,neutral,undefined
Couple of minutes.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It wasn't me she wanted to see.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
She wanted to see you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I woke up and she was sitting there.,Client,depression,undefined
I thought...,Client,depression,undefined
I thought for a moment that...,Client,depression,undefined

and that it all been in a bad dream.,Client,depression,undefined
I was still a child and...,Client,depression,undefined
I was sick and...,Client,depression,undefined
my mom was taking care of me.,Client,depression,undefined
And I'd never grown up...,Client,depression,undefined

worst than Kyle.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
That was never my intention.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Kyle took me out for coffee last week.,Client,anger,undefined
"He's been harrassing me. So I finally went just to shut it up, like",Client,anger,undefined
"I'm still alive, I'm in chemo.",Client,anger,undefined
Just leave me alone.,Client,anger,undefined
"And, he just seemed so young to me.",Client,anger,undefined
Like a baby.,Client,anger,undefined
I was thinking :,Client,anger,undefined
"I don't want a boy like you, I want someone like Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
A man.,Client,anger,undefined
What was it like to see him again ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't wanna talk about Kyle. I brought him up because...,Client,anger,undefined
Fuck it. Never mind.,Client,anger,undefined
I thought you were a man.,Client,anger,undefined
"So today, I'm... your betrayer ?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"But last week, you were equally certain that I was generous and good.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Can you see how dramatically your opinion of me has changed ?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Can you make sense of that for me ?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I guess I never really knew you.,Client,anger,undefined
Or maybe you're still angry at me,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're having a hard time seeing this situation from my perspective.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Don't lecture me on empathy.,Client,anger,undefined
I am not talking about empathy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm talking about perspective.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You feel deeply for people whom you believe are on your team,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"because they are, in your mind, basically extensions of yourself.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You feel their pain as if its your own pain.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you do have a hard time understanding someone,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
whose approaching from a different perspective.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were using your perspective to fuck me over.,Client,anger,undefined
"I thought you were in serious trouble, and your mother deserved to know.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Why ? You have no allegiance to her. You never met her.,Client,anger,undefined
As a father myself...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'll tell you what happened : you got scared.,Client,anger,undefined
You didn't want to be my emergency contact.,Client,anger,undefined
You didn't want that responsability.,Client,anger,undefined
"If I had a patient who asked me not to call her mother,",Client,anger,undefined
I never would've called her mother.,Client,anger,undefined
You don't have children !,Therapist,anger,Communication Skills
It's so easy to betray you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It so easy to let you down.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I make one mistake, not even a mistake,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
one decision that you don't agree with.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And that's it for you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm worthless because I'm weak.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That's a quality you can't accept in others because...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you can't accept it in yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But you know that nobody can live up to your standards,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

she'll forget we've made a plan at all.,Client,depression,undefined
But that doesn't bother you ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No,Client,depression,undefined
And what's special about your relationship with Leah ?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I know she loves me.,Client,depression,undefined
She's known me since I was six.,Client,depression,undefined
Before I had done anything.,Client,depression,undefined
So she loved you when you were a child.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She led inside before you closed the gates.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's so depressing.,Client,depression,undefined
Is it ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
To have one person who really knows who you are ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I used to be really different.,Client,depression,undefined
In what way ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was a total mess.,Client,depression,undefined
I was a total mess.,Client,depression,undefined
This really emotional kid.,Client,depression,undefined

that maturity in modern american society had become,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"synonymus with a lack of emotions,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
to not feel anything too deeply.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That's true.,Client,neutral,undefined
But some people naturally have,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
more heightened emotional responses than others.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think you are one of those people.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So you've been working hard to change your nature...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Which is probably a futile enterprise.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But a continual effort to do that,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
could make you very angry or insecure.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You think I'm insecure ?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
There's no good way for me to answer that question.,Client,anger,undefined

Why do you think your mother told you to...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
keep your feelings to yourself ?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
She wanted to keep me from getting hurt.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is it possible it had something to do with Daniel ?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What do you mean ?,Client,neutral,undefined
Daniel couldn't control his emotions,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and he became violent when he was upset.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So maybe a heightened emotional response from you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"even though it was an appropriate reaction to a given circumstance,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"maybe it reminded your mother of Daniel,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and in some way its scared her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The world is a messed up place.,Client,neutral,undefined
She was just trying to teach me to protect myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
But maybe she didn't give you time,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"to get to know yourself first,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to know who it is you are protecting.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You think I don't know myself ?,Client,anger,undefined
I think that you've been operating for a long time in reaction to your mother.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"At the hospital, she was so mad she wouldn't even look at me.",Client,depression,undefined
She just kept coming in and out of the room. Bossing the doctors around...,Client,depression,undefined
I just wanted her to leave.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe she wasn't actually angry.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe she was scared.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It doesn't matter.,Client,anger,undefined
It doesn't ?,Client,anger,undefined
"No, Paul. Not when I'm hooked up to three IVs.",Client,anger,undefined
"The only thing that matters, in that moment,",Client,anger,undefined
"is that my mother is there, and I can't deal with her.",Client,anger,undefined
My dad came by later...,Client,neutral,undefined
and he was perfect.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was freezing, so...",Client,neutral,undefined
he went out and bought me a damn blanket.,Client,neutral,undefined
Now whenever he comes he brings me... something special.,Client,neutral,undefined
There's this dark chocolate that I love.,Client,neutral,undefined
It weighs a ton and I never get it for myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
He brought me some.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And he sat by my bed and held my hand,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and just said : April,",Client,neutral,undefined
you're a strong girl. You'll beat this.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's all I need.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She's my mother, why doesn't she know that ?",Client,neutral,undefined
"He sounds very calm, your dad.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"He can be, under certain circumstances.",Client,neutral,undefined
Like hospitals ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What are you saying ?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, that's what he does for a living.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It might be easier for your father,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to give you what you need at the moment because he's had some practice.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But your mother...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
was out of her element.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't understand : are you for this woman or against her ?,Client,disgust,undefined
"April, everything doesn't have to be black and white.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're so over me.,Client,disgust,undefined
Sorry ?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You're so tired of this.,Client,disgust,undefined
You just want this to be done.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You want to figure me out, fix my head,",Client,disgust,undefined
so you can check me off your ledger.,Client,disgust,undefined
What about my behavior gave you that idea ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You turned on me.,Client,disgust,undefined
How ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
By calling my mother.,Client,anger,undefined
Were back to that again. So what I did still doesn't make sense to you ?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What are you talking about ?,Client,anger,undefined
For five sessions,Client,anger,undefined
all I've talked about is why I can't call my mother.,Client,anger,undefined
I was walking down Flatbush Avenue,Client,anger,undefined
"burning with fever, with a non-existent immune system,",Client,anger,undefined
"trying to hail a cab to take me to the emergency room,",Client,anger,undefined
and I still didn't call her.,Client,anger,undefined
"You pulled rank on me, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
"You were like : I've humored this chick for too long,",Client,anger,undefined
"I'm the adult, I'm gonna call the other adult.",Client,anger,undefined
so we can figure out how to...,Client,anger,undefined
how to fuck up the world together.,Client,anger,undefined
You don't think of yourself as an adult ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I guess I am.,Client,anger,undefined
Do you want to be ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not really.,Client,anger,undefined
Maybe that's because you barely had time to be a child.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Your work here is done.,Client,anger,undefined
Our work here is only beginning.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"well, you're wrong...",Client,anger,undefined
"You can check me off now. Now I'm in chemo,",Client,anger,undefined
"my mother knows, whatever.",Client,anger,undefined
You keep using the term check me off.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Does that mean anything to you ?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
My mother...,Client,depression,undefined
used to write a check on the back of my hand,Client,depression,undefined
"whenever I did a good deed, or aced a test, or something.",Client,depression,undefined
"She said I loved it, when I was little.",Client,depression,undefined
But something changed as you got older ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I felt like she was...,Client,depression,undefined
"you know, checking me off, like...",Client,depression,undefined
April's fine.,Client,depression,undefined
She's got a check. Don't need to worry about April.,Client,depression,undefined
"Got so tired of those goddamned checks, I stopped telling her things.",Client,depression,undefined
Like what ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know...,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know...,Client,depression,undefined
"I'd raised money for autism research, by running a 10K.",Client,depression,undefined
But you wouldn't tell her ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She'd find out later, from a teacher...",Client,depression,undefined
or the school newspaper.,Client,depression,undefined
Can you give me another example ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"When Leah's mom was dying, Leah couldn't handle it.",Client,depression,undefined
"Neither could her dad, so...",Client,depression,undefined
"I was over at their house, three times a week, helping out, just...",Client,depression,undefined
"buying groceries, making dinner.",Client,depression,undefined
But again your mother didn't know anything about this ?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She found out at the funeral. Leah's dad came up to her.,Client,depression,undefined
"It seems like you wanted your mother to know these things,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but you didn't want to tell her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe.,Client,depression,undefined
And what would happen if she found out ?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was her little hero...,Client,depression,undefined
her saving grace.,Client,depression,undefined
Her perfect child.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"April, is it possible that I've become part of that pattern ?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What ?,Client,neutral,undefined
You got cancer.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You decided to fight it alone, just as you've always done.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"you didn't tell your mother, but you came to see me.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You told me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Because, maybe you knew on some level,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that I would eventually tell your mother.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you would become our hero.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Again.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That is so fucked up.,Client,anger,undefined
"I don't think it is, April.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think you saved yourself,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
the only way you know how.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I thought that cancer would clean me out of all this bullshit.,Client,depression,undefined
I thought I would finally stop obsessing,Client,depression,undefined
"over how to be the best at everything,",Client,depression,undefined
and...,Client,depression,undefined
all the reasons I should hate myself and everyone else.,Client,depression,undefined
I thought I would...,Client,depression,undefined
"finally start to think about the big picture, but...",Client,depression,undefined
it's just gotten darker inside my head.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't believe in anything anymore.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't believe in love.,Client,depression,undefined
Or...,Client,depression,undefined
"my mother,",Client,depression,undefined
"not my body,",Client,depression,undefined
or you.,Client,depression,undefined
"Because of all this stupid therapy,",Client,anger,undefined
I don't even believe in myself anymore.,Client,anger,undefined
I literally have no idea why I should get out of bed in the morning.,Client,anger,undefined
"Because of all this stupid therapy,",Client,anger,undefined
I don't even believe in myself anymore.,Client,anger,undefined
I literally have no idea why I should get out of bed in the morning.,Client,anger,undefined
That's not a bad place,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"to begin, April.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Do you remember the dream that we talked about last week ?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
The one where I was dying ?,Client,depression,undefined
Except that I think that dream could actually have been about...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
rebirth.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
About saying goodbye to the old self,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to make room for the new.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I could just be dying.,Client,depression,undefined
When will you get the results of the blood tests ?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I told you, end of the week.",Client,depression,undefined
Then you will know for sure if the chemo is working.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Will you let me know the results as soon as you get them?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Sure.,Client,depression,undefined
Are we done here ?,Client,depression,undefined
If you want to keep on talking...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Not really.,Client,depression,undefined
Can you help me up ?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I never thought I'd be happy to be back here.,Client,joy,undefined
"But it feels good to get out of that place,",Client,joy,undefined
even if it's only for an hour.,Client,joy,undefined
So you haven't been out at all this week?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, a couple of times.",Client,neutral,undefined
Connie and...,Client,neutral,undefined
Natalie took me to lunch.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how was that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"It was a cute little Irish place, actually,",Client,neutral,undefined
right across the street. You probably would have liked it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I had stew,",Client,neutral,undefined
soda bread. Connie cried.,Client,neutral,undefined
I sat there wondering if everyone in the restaurant,Client,depression,undefined
made me for a guy being on lunch-leave from the rubber room.,Client,depression,undefined
"I doubt they were thinking that, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's humiliating.,Client,disgust,undefined
"My own daughter has to sign me out, sit in your waiting room,",Client,disgust,undefined
sign me back in,Client,disgust,undefined
like I'm a danger to society.,Client,disgust,undefined
I think the fear is that you might be a danger to yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Can I ask you something, Paul?",Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You said that this was one of the best facilities in the city?,Client,neutral,undefined
It is very highly regarded.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Then what are the rest of them like?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not complaining.,Client,neutral,undefined
You've been there yourself a few times now.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's clean, well lit.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why don't you just tell me what it is that bothers you about the place?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
It's the staff:,Client,disgust,undefined
"the therapists, social workers.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Maybe I've been spoiled by you, but these people, they just...",Client,disgust,undefined
They're just not very bright.,Client,disgust,undefined
How do you mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, you're either bright or you're not.",Client,neutral,undefined
You can't fake it.,Client,neutral,undefined
When I talk to you I don't have to explain myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You listen,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you understand what I'm saying, you respond right away.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If I mention a name even once,",Client,neutral,undefined
you remember it the next time.,Client,neutral,undefined
These people...,Client,disgust,undefined
They're just not up to speed.,Client,disgust,undefined
I have to backtrack all the time.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, I think that you and I have a relationship, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
And I can imagine how,Therapist,neutral,Approval
frustrating it must be to cover the same ground,Therapist,neutral,Approval
that we have in our sessions.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, but it's not only that.",Client,disgust,undefined
They talk to me like I'm a four-year-old...,Client,disgust,undefined
or maybe an 80-year-old who has to have everything explained,Client,disgust,undefined
to him,Client,disgust,undefined
loudly and slowly.,Client,disgust,undefined
So you feel patronized.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, exactly. See, that's it.",Client,disgust,undefined
That's what I mean... you understand me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, to be honest, Walter, that wasn't a difficult one.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I've never felt patronized by you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You respected me, I respected you.",Client,neutral,undefined
We're equals.,Client,joy,undefined
"I haven't really gotten that sense from you before, to be honest.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You haven't?,Client,neutral,undefined
Actually I've always felt,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"that I've kind of annoyed you,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that our talking together was a waste of your time.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"For example, when I draw connections between your past and your present,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
you've belittled them.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"If you felt that way, I'm sorry.",Client,neutral,undefined
The truth is that right from that first blink test,Client,neutral,undefined
I could see you were top notch.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And yet, I think I remember that",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you questioned my academic credentials.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And didn't you run a background check on me?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
There's that memory of yours... it won't let go of any details.,Client,neutral,undefined
You can see why I might be a little surprised,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
to hear that you're now singing my praises.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Boy, you have a hard time taking a compliment, don't you?",Client,joy,undefined
Maybe you should talk to somebody about that.,Client,joy,undefined
"Okay, since...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
since you have so much respect for my understanding of you...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
can I be blunt?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Absolutely.,Client,joy,undefined
Why are you sucking up to me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Excuse me?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I think you're right, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I have tried to empathize with you,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"and I know that I've made some mistakes,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
but I think I have a pretty fair idea of your opinion of me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So I'll ask you again:,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
why are you sucking up to me?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Let me show you something.,Client,depression,undefined
What is it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's a potholder.,Client,depression,undefined
I made it myself... in occupational therapy.,Client,depression,undefined
Tomorrow we're gonna glue little bits of tile together,Client,depression,undefined
and make coasters.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't imagine you're the best candidate,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
for occupational therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I'm used to being the glue, Paul, not playing with it.",Client,depression,undefined
I'm sure that's not all you're doing in there.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"No, of course not.",Client,depression,undefined
Then there's group therapy...,Client,anger,undefined
"which isn't only a waste of time, it's disturbing.",Client,anger,undefined
I just sit there and I listen to strangers talking about,Client,anger,undefined
"how this one was abandoned or that one was molested,",Client,anger,undefined
and how angry they are at their parents.,Client,anger,undefined
So how do you feel about being on the same floor as these people?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I guess I'm supposed to relate to them",Client,anger,undefined
or sympathize or you tell me.,Client,anger,undefined
"But come on, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
"Two months ago I was a fully-engaged C.E.O.,",Client,anger,undefined
solving real-world problems.,Client,anger,undefined
And now I'm sitting between one person who likes to wear diapers,Client,anger,undefined
and another one who likes to cut herself with a razor.,Client,anger,undefined
There's no denying that you have it rough.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And you must be angry at me for saying that you need to be there.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, you were just doing your job.",Client,neutral,undefined
I can imagine you also might be angry,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that I wasn't able to save you from the depression you fell into.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Or from the attempt that you made on your own life.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You know, one of the shrinks there said something like that.",Client,depression,undefined
He said you were reckless.,Client,depression,undefined
Said that you'd opened up,Client,depression,undefined
Pandora's box at the worst possible time.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm sorry... should I not have told you that?,Client,depression,undefined
But I'm sure that must have been unsettling for you to hear.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
What do you think he meant by that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I didn't trust it.",Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't trust him.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I told him that if it hadn't have been for you,",Client,neutral,undefined
that I'd gone off the deep end a lot sooner.,Client,neutral,undefined
I also told him that his staff wasn't in your league.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You're doing it again, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
Bullshitting me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Now what is it that you want from me?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Out.,Client,neutral,undefined
I want out.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you're hoping that if you flatter me enough,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"that I'll sign off on your release, is that it?",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I'm climbing the walls, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
And it's another week before I can go before a judge.,Client,depression,undefined
"Look, I understand that a week may seem like a very long time.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"God, another day is an eternity.",Client,depression,undefined
"Whatever you need me to say or sign, I'll do it.",Client,depression,undefined
"But please, call Dr. Wells.",Client,depression,undefined
He'll listen to you.,Client,depression,undefined
"Before I do that,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
we need to talk more.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What do you want to know?,Client,neutral,undefined
What do I want to know?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Isn't that what you said to me last week in the hospital?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And then you proceeded to tell me that you had food poisoning.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Drop the facade, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's a waste of your time and mine.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're just saying what you think I want to hear.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I was ashamed.,Client,depression,undefined
And I didn't want Natalie to know.,Client,depression,undefined
Why don't you tell me what it's,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
really been like this last week.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Hell.,Client,depression,undefined
I have nothing to do.,Client,depression,undefined
There's one TV and,Client,depression,undefined
the group votes on what crap they want to watch.,Client,depression,undefined
There's a piano that no one can play.,Client,depression,undefined
"They give us chores,",Client,depression,undefined
but it's make-work.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not doing anything.,Client,depression,undefined
So how do you pass the time?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Walk the halls.,Client,depression,undefined
It's 9:00 a.m.,Client,depression,undefined
"I pace,",Client,depression,undefined
stare out the window.,Client,depression,undefined
Hours go by.,Client,depression,undefined
"I think to myself,",Client,depression,undefined
it must be getting close to lunchtime.,Client,depression,undefined
I look at the clock.,Client,depression,undefined
It's 9:15.,Client,depression,undefined
"When you stare out the windows,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
what do you think about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think about how much I could've already gotten done,Client,depression,undefined
if I still had my job.,Client,depression,undefined
I think about how much I could've already gotten done,Client,depression,undefined

You're used to being busy.,Client,depression,undefined
I can imagine it's...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's a pretty difficult adjustment.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I can't adjust.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not comfortable just wasting time.,Client,depression,undefined
That's something that we might work on while you're there.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You want me to work on wasting time?,Client,depression,undefined
"No, what I mean is",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
sometimes when people are hospitalized,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
the lack of day-to-day pressure can cause a relief.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
It finally gives them a chance to...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
To contemplate.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't follow you.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, to reflect.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"To reflect on what's come before, what lies ahead.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I think you've been running so hard for so long,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
that you haven't had the chance to check in,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
with yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Natalie said something like that.,Client,neutral,undefined
She said I should listen to my inner voice.,Client,depression,undefined
I told her the last thing you want to do,Client,depression,undefined
if you're in a nuthouse is start hearing voices.,Client,depression,undefined
"When you walk the halls, what do you find yourself thinking about?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm just anxious.,Client,depression,undefined
I think about money.,Client,depression,undefined

I think that...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills

You've survived it.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You've been given a second chance.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

maybe the void that you still feel can be filled...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and that there's a possibility of renewal.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You know, I tried to fight it.",Client,depression,undefined
"I kept telling myself, Snap out of it, Walter.",Client,depression,undefined
Snap out of it.,Client,depression,undefined
I kept thinking that...,Client,depression,undefined
I'd come up with some way,Client,depression,undefined
to stop feeling.,Client,depression,undefined
Stop feeling what?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
To stop feeling.,Client,depression,undefined
Period.,Client,depression,undefined
I've always been able to will myself out of bed.,Client,depression,undefined
Even if I was dead tired or sick...,Client,depression,undefined
I was always able to work.,Client,depression,undefined
"Ring the bell, I answered.",Client,depression,undefined
But not this time.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's like...,Client,depression,undefined
"there's the Walter Barnett that I knew,",Client,depression,undefined
who could...,Client,depression,undefined
stand up to any pressure.,Client,depression,undefined
And then...,Client,depression,undefined
there's this other Walter who I never knew existed...,Client,depression,undefined
who crumbled...,Client,depression,undefined
who couldn't handle the pain.,Client,depression,undefined
"These two Walters,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"one strong, the other weak...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure

"The other one, you mean... The one without a job?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You said anytime the bell rang, you answered.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe part of the reason you couldn't snap out of it this time was because,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for the first time in your life...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you weren't on call. You weren't on duty.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What do you mean?,Client,depression,undefined
"You pride yourself not just on your ability to work,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but on your ability to work yourself,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
beyond the brink of exhaustion.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The first day,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you didn't even think that your panic attacks were worth mentioning.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"In the time that I've known you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I've never heard you mention a hobby,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"a day off, a night out.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You met me in the middle of a crisis.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And my guess is, before this crisis there was another crisis",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and before that there was another one. And it stretches right back...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"to childhood, to Vietnam, to the Donaldsons,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to Connie's rehab.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Connie's rehab?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What? I never said anything about that.,Client,anger,undefined
"You didn't, but when I spoke to Natalie at the hospital...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She had no right to embarrass Connie like that!,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She wasn't trying to embarrass Connie.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
She assumed you'd told me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Why would I have done that?,Client,anger,undefined
That's what people do in therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
They talk about their... lives.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
If your wife has a problem with substance abuse...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Substance abuse? It was chardonnays.,Client,anger,undefined
And a few pills.,Client,anger,undefined
She's not a...,Client,anger,undefined
Connie is a great wife.,Client,anger,undefined
She made a fine home. She took care of the kids.,Client,anger,undefined
She watched the home front like a hawk.,Client,anger,undefined
The problem started...,Client,anger,undefined
It's my fault.,Client,anger,undefined
What was your fault?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was away so much. I was always traveling.,Client,anger,undefined
The doctors never understood what it was. It was...,Client,anger,undefined
"maybe a hypoglycemia,",Client,anger,undefined
"or lyme disease, something chemical.",Client,anger,undefined
She gets in a mood and... she slides downhill.,Client,anger,undefined
And you were there to catch her.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'd be halfway around the world.,Client,anger,undefined
I'd get a call from the boys or her mother.,Client,anger,undefined
I'd be on the next flight back.,Client,anger,undefined
I've always been her rock.,Client,anger,undefined
Until now.,Client,anger,undefined
Now I've let her down.,Client,depression,undefined
I've let everyone down.,Client,depression,undefined
You're a human being.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I'm not supposed to malfunction, Paul, that's for other people.",Client,anger,undefined
But not Walter Barnett.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
He's a superman.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Isn't that what your wife used to call you?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
That's just a figure of speech.,Client,anger,undefined
But it's a pretty telling one.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You've been everyone's rock... your entire life.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You make it sound like that's something bad to be responsible.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm just wondering about the toll that it's taken...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
the pressure or maybe even the need to always be the hero.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Need?,Client,anger,undefined
Do you think I look for this?,Client,anger,undefined
That's not what I meant.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You think I'm like a fireman who goes setting fires so I can put them out?,Client,anger,undefined
That's not the point.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Then what is your damn point?,Client,anger,undefined
"Come on, you know everything. Just tell me what you fucking think.",Client,anger,undefined
I don't think you want the crisis.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But I do worry you have no idea what to do when you're not in one.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're angry at yourself...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
for crumbling under this pressure.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But I'm amazed you've held everything together for as long as you did.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Thanks a lot.,Client,neutral,undefined
The Walter you know...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
has been on the front line since his brother died...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"on call, taking care of everything, everybody,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
sleeping with one eye open.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But without a mountain of responsibility,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that Walter is completely lost.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He doesn't know how not to be in charge.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He's forgotten how to play.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He can't just sit and be.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe that's why you're climbing the walls at the hospital.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Then get me out of there!,Client,anger,undefined
And if I did...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
what would happen to the other Walter?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What are you talking about?,Client,anger,undefined
"The Walter you said you didn't know existed,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
the little boy who had his childhood taken away from him,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
when he was six years old.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
He's been sitting there...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
all this time in the dark...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
scared half to death...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
hoping that somebody would notice him...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
maybe comfort him.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And maybe...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Maybe this is his chance.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Your chance...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
to find out who that boy is...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
To reconnect with a part of yourself,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that you've had to deny your entire life.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Am I making any sense to you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You want me to connect to that part of myself that...,Client,depression,undefined
"that fell apart, that...",Client,depression,undefined
crumbled under pressure?,Client,depression,undefined
Why would I do that?,Client,depression,undefined
"Because, Walter, I don't think that's the part of you that crumbled.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think that's the part of you that wants to live.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm sorry...,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm sorry about the phone business.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm trying to get my father's estate settled,Client,depression,undefined
and I can't even get anybody to talk to me. All I get is,Client,anger,undefined
"Can you hold? Please, hold. Let me put you on hold.",Client,anger,undefined
That's so irritating.,Client,anger,undefined
If I believed the operators,Client,anger,undefined
"were actually helping somebody, I would wait.",Client,anger,undefined
Sometimes I think the whole country is on hold.,Client,anger,undefined
Nobody is being helped.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
They don't even call it help any more.,Client,anger,undefined
They call it customer support.,Client,anger,undefined
"That's 'cause all they really do is say,",Client,anger,undefined
I'm sorry you have a problem. That's too bad.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, you know what? I don't want support. I want your help.",Client,anger,undefined
So I hang up.,Client,anger,undefined
Is there something I can help you with?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Unless you want to proofread a letter I wrote.,Client,depression,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What kind of letter?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Remember last week I left here and I went to meet with Alex's father?,Client,depression,undefined
"Yeah, how did that go?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Disorienting.,Client,depression,undefined
Disorienting.,Client,depression,undefined
He offered to accept settlement money from the insurance company,Client,depression,undefined
and drop his lawsuit against me...,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, that's great.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
... in exchange,Client,depression,undefined
for a letter from me admitting,Client,depression,undefined
my guilt in Alex's death.,Client,depression,undefined
You wrote the letter?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What would he do with this letter?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He gave me his word he wouldn't do anything with it.,Client,depression,undefined
Paul.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I know. You're right.,Client,depression,undefined
"Once he has it, technically, he can do anything he wants with it.",Client,depression,undefined
Send it to the ethics board or post it online.,Client,depression,undefined
That would be the end of your career.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What did your lawyer say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He says the letter,Client,depression,undefined
will put an end to the lawsuit and that my insurance,Client,depression,undefined
will cover the whole settlement. I won't end up owing a thing.,Client,depression,undefined
What happens if you don't send it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They have a preliminary hearing next week. The judge...,Client,depression,undefined
He could just throw the whole case out.,Client,depression,undefined
"But if he doesn't, it might go to trial with a jury,",Client,depression,undefined
in which case I will lose big time.,Client,depression,undefined
How do you know that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The lawyer says that's what juries do.,Client,depression,undefined
The lawyer says that's what juries do.,Client,depression,undefined
He says everybody hates therapists.,Client,depression,undefined
They do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"According to this guy, therapy is bullshit.",Client,depression,undefined
He says people go into treatment,Client,depression,undefined
hoping that the therapist is gonna fix them.,Client,depression,undefined
But that therapists either don't solve people's problems,Client,depression,undefined
or they make them worse.,Client,depression,undefined
And this man is representing you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He fights cases like this every week. He knows how they go.,Client,anger,undefined
And he's worried that the jury is gonna see me,Client,anger,undefined
"as a stand-in for all the bad therapists in the world,",Client,anger,undefined
and award Alex's father the entire $20 million.,Client,anger,undefined
"If this lawyer knew what he was doing,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
he'd get the jury to see what a good therapist you are.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Excuse me for a second, I'm just curious.",Client,anger,undefined
"What would you say if you were on trial and the lawyer asked you,",Client,anger,undefined
What percentage of your patients do you think you've really helped?,Client,anger,undefined
What are you asking?,Client,anger,undefined
"Would you say, on average,",Client,anger,undefined
"that the people you've treated have gotten a little better,",Client,anger,undefined
"a lot better, or they've stayed about the same?",Client,anger,undefined
You're someone I treat.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you asking me if I'll help you get better?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Fine, don't answer the question. This isn't about you anyway.",Client,anger,undefined
This is about me.,Client,anger,undefined
The way I feel about it is I'm not helping anybody.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm going to mail this letter,Client,anger,undefined
"and I'm gonna quit being a therapist and find something better to do,",Client,anger,undefined
something useful.,Client,anger,undefined
You know you help people.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You know what I do? Most days, I sit there and I listen",Client,anger,undefined
for 45 minutes. Then my patients go out the door,Client,anger,undefined
and do whatever they were gonna do anyway.,Client,anger,undefined
"Paul, you don't just listen. You make observations.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You ask questions. You make interpretations.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You encourage people to look at the patterns of their behavior.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"That may be what I do, but it's not what people want.",Client,anger,undefined
And what do they want?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"They want to be loved,",Client,anger,undefined
"even by me. They want a child, or they want to be my child.",Client,anger,undefined
They want a parent who loves them.,Client,anger,undefined
"They want attention, they want affection. They want hope,",Client,anger,undefined
"they want pills, and they want sex.",Client,anger,undefined
It's a good list.,Client,anger,undefined
But I don't give them those things.,Client,anger,undefined
"My patient Mia, the lawyer,",Client,anger,undefined
do you know what she wants?,Client,anger,undefined
"She wants me to hold her, to comfort her.",Client,anger,undefined
But what she really needs is a good husband and a family.,Client,anger,undefined
And I know that I cannot give her those things.,Client,anger,undefined
All I can do is show her she pushes away the very people who could help her,Client,anger,undefined
and that she pulls on the people who won't.,Client,anger,undefined
But that only leaves her feeling more lonely and unloved.,Client,anger,undefined
"By the time she left on Monday, by the time she left my office,",Client,anger,undefined
"she felt doomed,",Client,anger,undefined
rejected by her family and the world.,Client,anger,undefined
And I had absolutely nothing to say to her.,Client,anger,undefined
So you're worried she won't come back?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Why should she come back, really?",Client,anger,undefined
I am of no use to her whatsoever.,Client,anger,undefined
All this big wisdom that I'm supposed to be giving her.,Client,anger,undefined
This isn't going to make her happy.,Client,anger,undefined
"Is that what you want to do, make people happy?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Absolutely, I want to make people happy.",Client,anger,undefined
"What do you want to do, fuck them up even more?",Client,anger,undefined
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna mail this letter,Client,anger,undefined
"and I'm gonna let them take my license,",Client,anger,undefined
and I'm gonna become a life coach.,Client,anger,undefined
A life coach?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What do they do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You know what a life coach is.,Client,anger,undefined
They give advice.,Client,anger,undefined
It's not...,Client,anger,undefined
"Look, people don't have families anymore that they can talk to,",Client,anger,undefined
and friends are quickly going the way of families.,Client,anger,undefined
"So if you were Mia's life coach,",Client,neutral,undefined
what would you tell her to do?,Client,neutral,undefined
I would tell her to quit her job.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I would tell her to grow her hair,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I would tell her to move somewhere where she's outside in the sunshine,",Client,neutral,undefined
"like Napa Valley. I would tell her to take up biking,",Client,neutral,undefined
"not wear heels for a year. And I'd tell her, Get a dog.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think that she would take your advice?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She just wants me to give her love,Client,neutral,undefined
and support.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But if she were capable of receiving love and support,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
she wouldn't be coming to you for them.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
That's her real problem.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"And until it's treated, she won't be able to take anyone's advice.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
And that's why she needs therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Actually, I think if my first advice worked,",Client,anger,undefined
she might try some other new idea.,Client,anger,undefined
"If my advice didn't work out,",Client,anger,undefined
she'd go in another direction. I don't see what the harm is.,Client,anger,undefined
Would you want the responsibility for making her decisions for her?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I think I'd be fine with that.,Client,anger,undefined
"You see, that's your problem right there.",Client,anger,undefined
You're scared of taking responsibility for your patients' lives.,Client,anger,undefined
You don't actually want to get involved with them.,Client,anger,undefined
I do.,Client,anger,undefined
So you still cling to this dogma,Client,anger,undefined
of letting them make their own decisions.,Client,anger,undefined
"But that, in my opinion, that's not professionalism. That's cowardice.",Client,anger,undefined
"You know, it's not dogma.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
It's a basic tenet of our profession.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"If you take action in your patients' lives,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
you cause them to become dependent on you.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
You cripple them.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Back on the high moral ground again, as usual.",Client,anger,undefined
"But you've got it wrong, Gina.",Client,anger,undefined
My problem isn't that I can't obey the rules.,Client,anger,undefined
"My problem is that, unlike you, I actually give a shit",Client,anger,undefined
about my patients.,Client,anger,undefined
You think I don't care about you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You don't let yourself care about anybody.,Client,anger,undefined
"You're too afraid to. You sit in that goddamn chair,",Client,anger,undefined
"and your patients are falling apart in front of you,",Client,anger,undefined
"but instead of reaching out to help,",Client,anger,undefined
you study them as if they were pieces of a puzzle.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, I let you down.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And you're enraged at me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I was your teacher. I was your mentor.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I was supposed to give you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the wisdom that would protect you from this sort of pain.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The pain you're going through now.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And I didn't.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And so you're reacting by telling me that I'm not feeling your pain,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

We both know that you don't believe a word of that bullshit.,Client,anger,undefined
"If anything, you think that I've disappointed you.",Client,anger,undefined
"You keep telling me I'm a good person. You're a great therapist, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
But we both know how little respect you really have for me.,Client,anger,undefined
"You pretend to be neutral, but you have done nothing but judge me",Client,anger,undefined
since the minute I came back into therapy.,Client,anger,undefined
So you think I've been judging you all this time?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"For fuck's sake, stop mirroring what I say.",Client,anger,undefined
"For fuck's sake, stop mirroring what I say.",Client,anger,undefined
"Would you stop hiding behind the cloak,",Client,anger,undefined
"drop the fucking catlike smile, the bullshit Buddha pose of yours,",Client,anger,undefined
and just tell me for once what you really think?,Client,anger,undefined
What do I really think?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I really think that you're acting like an asshole.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I really think that you're a therapist who has remarkably,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
little insight into your own behavior.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You are so self-absorbed.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
You are so entitled.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
You come in here and you spout the same old bullshit!,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
I want to cross the boundaries,Therapist,anger,Restatement
because I care so much!,Therapist,anger,Restatement
And I have to sit here and listen.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
And then you have the gall to get mad at me,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
for not losing my temper!,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
"Well, at least I finally know.",Client,anger,undefined
You know nothing.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
That's right. I'm a self-absorbed asshole and you're furious at me.,Client,anger,undefined
I am furious at you.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
Let me ask you...,Client,anger,undefined
How did saying that make you feel?,Client,anger,undefined
It felt good.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
But maybe that's exactly what you wanted.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
"And what did I want, Gina? You tell me.",Client,anger,undefined
You got me to play the role you relish.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
"You got me to be the punishing, rejecting parent,",Therapist,anger,Interpretation
the failed authority figure that you can rail against.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
Why would I want that?,Client,anger,undefined
Because it's familiar.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
It confirms your worldview.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
You get to be the innocent victim,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
doing your best. And I'm just like everyone else. I'm out to fuck you over.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So you call me an asshole, and not only is it my fault,",Therapist,anger,Interpretation
it's actually what I wanted.,Client,anger,undefined
"You tell me, how do you feel?",Therapist,anger,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

I bet you feel good.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure

You've always thought that.,Client,anger,undefined
Have I?,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
Have I always thought that?,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
"Then why do you think I've stuck by you all these years,",Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
even when you've been a complete pain in the ass?,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
The truth is...,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure

it's clear to me how carefully you listen.,Therapist,neutral,Approval

Then why am I failing them?,Client,depression,undefined
"It's not about you, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You know, they're human beings.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

If only you could find courage,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to sit with the fact that what we do is hard,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and sometimes, it makes you feel like an idiot.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's a humbling profession.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And if you lack anything as a therapist, it's humility.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Somehow you have to learn to tolerate the fact that we don't save people.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

When did this happen?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
About 10 days ago.,Client,depression,undefined
You didn't even mention it last week.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills

just one wrong thing...,Client,depression,undefined

Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
And she's staring at me with those eyes that would break your heart.,Client,depression,undefined
She's just starting to live her life,Client,depression,undefined
"and all I wanna say to her is, Get out, run away.",Client,depression,undefined
"But I can't do that, because if she goes,",Client,depression,undefined
so does Walter.,Client,depression,undefined
I sat with him for hours,Client,depression,undefined
"trying to tell him that his life can still have meaning,",Client,depression,undefined
that even though he's overwhelmed with guilt,Client,depression,undefined
"and loss and shame, he has to push on,",Client,depression,undefined
"that he doesn't know what life might have in store for him,",Client,depression,undefined
what his third act could be.,Client,depression,undefined
"Except he knows, he knows damn well",Client,depression,undefined
what his third act is going to be...,Client,depression,undefined
"a long, steady decline,",Client,depression,undefined
just like my father's.,Client,depression,undefined
So...,Client,depression,undefined
maybe he's right,Client,depression,undefined
"to try for a millionaire's death, as he calls it,",Client,depression,undefined
to take control for himself,Client,depression,undefined
"on his terms, instead of letting the universe",Client,depression,undefined
continue to...,Client,depression,undefined
torture him.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you really believe that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I can see how he got there,",Client,depression,undefined
how somebody would just want to close their eyes,Client,depression,undefined
and not wake up.,Client,depression,undefined
"I can see how he got there,",Client,depression,undefined
how somebody would just want to close their eyes,Client,depression,undefined
and not wake up.,Client,depression,undefined
Have you been thinking you might like to go to sleep yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
But I haven't lost everything I ever wanted.,Client,neutral,undefined
If I did...,Client,neutral,undefined
If you did?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I'm not going to kill myself, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
Tell me why not.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
For fuck's sake...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Paul, you know what I'm asking you.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You're vulnerable here.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You don't have to worry, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
I have children.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I remember, you know, after my mother died,",Client,sadness,undefined
I was standing above her grave and I promised myself,Client,sadness,undefined
that I would never ever do that,Client,sadness,undefined
to one of my kids.,Client,sadness,undefined
"And then Ian was born, and then Rosie and Max.",Client,neutral,undefined
I made the same promise to myself over and over and over again.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I felt this rush,Client,neutral,undefined
of warmth,Client,neutral,undefined
"through my body. I am good,",Client,neutral,undefined
I am strong.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sometimes I feel like I'm this great tree,Client,neutral,undefined
"giant, powerful,",Client,neutral,undefined
and they're gonna live their whole lives beneath my shade.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then sometimes I feel...,Client,sadness,undefined
I feel like all my leaves have just fallen away...,Client,sadness,undefined
And I can't do anything for them...,Client,sadness,undefined
except...,Client,sadness,undefined
block the view.,Client,sadness,undefined
They still need you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I don't know about that.,Client,sadness,undefined
They do.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You still need your mother, don't you?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Can you imagine?,Client,sadness,undefined
She'd be 80 by now.,Client,sadness,undefined
She'd have got to see her grandkids grow up.,Client,sadness,undefined
Do you think that would have made her happier?,Client,sadness,undefined
"Can I ask you something, Gina?",Client,depression,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Have you ever thought about...,Client,neutral,undefined
suicide?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
When David was dying?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, not when David was dying.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"But afterwards,",Client,neutral,undefined
when you were grieving?,Client,neutral,undefined
He was a young man...&,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
he was so young when he got cancer,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
and his life was stolen from him.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
"And you watch someone die, someone who wants to live and...",Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
I'm sorry I didn't make it to David's funeral.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sorry I wasn't there for you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
And what about your patient with cancer? How's she doing?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
She gets the result of the blood test this week.,Client,depression,undefined
How is she doing emotionally?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She's kind of furious at me.,Client,depression,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's a long story.,Client,depression,undefined
And what about your patient with cancer? How's she doing?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
She gets the result of the blood test this week.,Client,depression,undefined
How is she doing emotionally?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She's kind of furious at me.,Client,depression,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's a long story.,Client,depression,undefined
"She was in the hospital. She was really really sick,",Client,depression,undefined
but she hadn't told her mother.,Client,depression,undefined
So I thought that her mother deserved to know.,Client,depression,undefined
Of course she did. You were right.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Someday, April will thank you.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Maybe.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Listen, Gina,",Client,depression,undefined
I'm exhausted.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't want to talk anymore.,Client,depression,undefined
I think I'll go get,Client,depression,undefined
a coffee or something before I pick up the kids.,Client,depression,undefined
Are you all right? I'll go with you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"No, it's okay, I'm fine.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm just tired, that's all.",Client,neutral,undefined
I forgot my letter.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'll keep this,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"I'll keep this,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"you know, for you. And then",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"you take this week, you think about it.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"And if you want it back, if you wanna send it,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I'll give it to you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Take a week to do what?,Client,neutral,undefined
To see your patients.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"That's what I've been saying,",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't want to see my patients.,Client,neutral,undefined
"See your patients, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Act as if you believe you're helping.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Hello, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So how have you been?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Quiet.,Client,depression,undefined
I hadn't heard from you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Did you get my message?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yes. Thanks for your call.,Client,depression,undefined
And how are you feeling?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How do I look?,Client,depression,undefined
"That's a lawyer technique, right... answer a question with a question?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Well, I thought I'd hit bottom",Client,neutral,undefined
"at the end of the last session,",Client,neutral,undefined
but it went downhill from there.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I did figure something out, though.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm stopping therapy.,Client,neutral,undefined
I appreciate what you've done.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know I'm a tough case.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But if every time you go to the doctor,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you end up feeling worse, then it's time to move on.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And I could have called, but I wanted to come in and say goodbye",Client,neutral,undefined
and wrap things up.,Client,neutral,undefined
I understand.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You're not going to try to convince me to stay?,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that what you'd like me to do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I just assumed you'd be all over me... therapy this, therapy that.",Client,neutral,undefined
You want me to hard-sell you,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
like a guy selling you a vegetable peeler on the street?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Jeez, Paul,",Client,joy,undefined
don't I get to be the angry one here?,Client,neutral,undefined
You mad because I want to leave or has something happened?,Client,neutral,undefined
You look like you want to take your ball and go home.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe you're right.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"If therapy hasn't helped,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"the last thing I want to do is keep you here, make you feel worse.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
That's what happened after the last session.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I felt like shit.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And I went home and I called my dad,",Client,disgust,undefined
thinking that I should get to the bottom of everything.,Client,disgust,undefined
He came over and I started asking questions,Client,disgust,undefined
"about my childhood, all the things we'd talked about.",Client,disgust,undefined
He turned it on me...,Client,disgust,undefined
"why was I creating problems, bringing up ancient history?",Client,anger,undefined
Maybe he felt threatened.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Especially when I asked him if it was his idea to sell the piano.,Client,anger,undefined
He lost it...,Client,anger,undefined
I shouldn't blame him; I should be grateful;,Client,anger,undefined
I wouldn't be alive without him;,Client,anger,undefined
"that I was impossible from the day I was born,",Client,anger,undefined
and maybe that's why my mother went nuts.,Client,anger,undefined
So it was all your fault.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah and he went on...,Client,anger,undefined
it's no surprise that I can't find a man;,Client,anger,undefined
who would want,Client,anger,undefined
a woman like me?,Client,anger,undefined
"And then he walked out,",Client,depression,undefined
saying that he didn't want to talk to me again.,Client,depression,undefined
So therapy isn't the only reason you had a bad week.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I never would have confronted him if I hadn't been talking to you.,Client,anger,undefined
"So thanks to all of this, I have...",Client,anger,undefined
lost my father.,Client,anger,undefined
You haven't lost your father.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"He's still in your life,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but you did lose the father that you thought you had.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He didn't refute your mother's version of events.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He just chose not to answer.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And that confirms a lot of the things that we've been talking about in here.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Okay, Paul, I get it.",Client,anger,undefined
I didn't have the perfect dad.,Client,anger,undefined
You're right and I'm wrong. Is that what you want?,Client,anger,undefined
"So put that in today's session notes, which I hope you keep now...",Client,anger,undefined
successfully shattered patient m's,Client,anger,undefined
romanticized image of her narcissistic father.,Client,anger,undefined
Actually what I would write is,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Mia, born to a depressed mother,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
idealizes her father so as not to feel completely alone.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"And this week, after finally confronting him,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
she can see her dad for who he really is.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"It is shattering,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
but if you can now move beyond that connection to your father,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
it may open the possibility,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
of finding love elsewhere.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"You mean, if I stay in therapy.",Client,neutral,undefined
That's one way.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
It's certainly not the only way.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Good, because I really am done.",Client,anger,undefined
"In fact, maybe I should get going.",Client,anger,undefined
"You can, of course.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"But since you're here, maybe we can at least work on...",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
closure.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I know you were unhappy about the last time,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
that we ended therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I'd like to do a better job this time.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
How long does that take?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, that's up to you.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"If this is your last session, we'll use the time that's left.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"And I'll be honest, you be honest.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
How's that?,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Okay, last session.",Client,anger,undefined
What do we do?,Client,anger,undefined
You haven't told me what happened after your father left.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
That's how we do closure?,Client,anger,undefined
Couldn't we just burn some sage or something?,Client,anger,undefined
That's how we do closure?,Client,anger,undefined
Couldn't we just burn some sage or something?,Client,anger,undefined
"I enjoy your humor a lot, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
But sometimes I feel it's a way of...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It's a way of hiding.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"After dad left,",Therapist,depression,Self-disclosure
I pretty much stayed home all week,Client,depression,undefined
in bed.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I know that sounds bad, but I'm here now,",Client,depression,undefined
so I got through it.,Client,depression,undefined
Did you get out of bed at all?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Bathroom trips, kitchen trips.",Client,neutral,undefined
I answered the door for deliveries.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you talk to anybody?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"My trusty assistant Henry,",Client,neutral,undefined
who threatened to come over and cook for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
You didn't want to call me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What would I have said...,Client,depression,undefined
I'm under the covers 'cause I'm afraid of the living room?,Client,depression,undefined
"If that's how you felt, then yes.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Have you been feeling a little hopeless?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I'm not suicidal, Paul, don't worry.",Client,depression,undefined
"I'm not suicidal, Paul, don't worry.",Client,depression,undefined
I am pretty tough.,Client,depression,undefined
Does being tough mean you have to suffer through things like this alone?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I just felt like the bed was safe,Client,depression,undefined
and the living room,Client,depression,undefined
was scary.,Client,depression,undefined
So you took to bed,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
like your mother did.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She had post-partum.,Client,depression,undefined
What's my excuse... post-non-partum?,Client,depression,undefined
"I wouldn't belittle what you've been through, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You wanted a child.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You thought you were having one.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's a painful loss.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And on top of that, when you were vulnerable",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"and need your father the most,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"he wasn't there for you,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
maybe the same way he wasn't there for your mother,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
when she couldn't get out of bed.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
This is exactly why I'm done with therapy.,Client,anger,undefined
"Every time we talk, I feel like",Client,anger,undefined
I need to see a therapist just to get through the day.,Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, I hear you.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
No more dad. No more mom.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is this how closure works?,Client,anger,undefined
"You remind me of my miserable family life,",Client,anger,undefined
"and then my love life, and then what? Global warming?",Client,anger,undefined
So what would you like to talk about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was thinking about getting a parrot,Client,neutral,undefined
"as a pet,",Client,neutral,undefined
instead of a boyfriend or a therapist.,Client,neutral,undefined
I could name it paul,Client,neutral,undefined
"and I could teach it to say things like,",Client,neutral,undefined
what would you like to talk about?,Client,neutral,undefined
Or is it me or is it your father?,Client,neutral,undefined
But then I found out that parrots live for about 80 years.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I don't think I could stand anybody for that long.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So you want to go, but you also want to keep me around,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
or at least you want to keep my voice.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Look, paul,",Client,neutral,undefined
I like you,Client,neutral,undefined
I like you as a person.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, that's pretty obvious.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If we were friends,",Client,neutral,undefined
that would be great.,Client,neutral,undefined
But we're not.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I don't imagine you're going to become my friend.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's against the rules.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Unless, of course, my name were laura.",Client,anger,undefined
You're still angry about that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe I'm just an angry person,Client,anger,undefined
and I should just accept myself for who I am.,Client,anger,undefined
"No, you're specifically angry at me.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"No, I said I like you.",Client,anger,undefined
And you want me as a friend but not as a therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You want what I can't give you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What else is new?,Client,anger,undefined
"Maybe the question isn't why you're leaving, mia,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but why you came back in the first place.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You clearly knew that I was being sued for malpractice. And,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you believed that I had failed you 20 years ago.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Think about it. What kind of choice was that?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
It wasn't a really good one.,Client,anger,undefined
"Or maybe it was perfect,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
if you were trying to choose a therapist in the same way that,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you choose the men in your life,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"look for someone who's likely to let you down,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"do everything you can to drive him away,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and when he fails you, which he must inevitably,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
then you get to rage against him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Nicely done.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You've even doubled back to dad, without having to mention him.",Client,disgust,undefined
Nicely done.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You've even doubled back to dad, without having to mention him.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Look, mia, of course you're free to leave",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"therapy,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"but my guess is, until you untangle those",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"crossed wires,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"the next man, and the one after that, and the one after that",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
they're going to disappoint you too.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
That's my lifelong pattern,Client,depression,undefined
because I've been,Client,depression,undefined
too attached to bad dad?,Client,depression,undefined
Why didn't you tell me this 20 years ago?,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, what the fuck?",Client,anger,undefined
Are you saying it's my fault?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe I would have had a decent life if I had known that.,Client,anger,undefined
It's a little late now.,Client,anger,undefined
Would you have even heard me if I'd said it that back then?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
So you waited?,Client,anger,undefined
"And while you waited, I hit perimenopause? Great.",Client,anger,undefined
"You're doing it again, mia.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What?,Client,anger,undefined
Blaming me for not giving you what you need when you needed it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Now I get it,Client,anger,undefined
closure is you telling me that it's all my fault,Client,anger,undefined
and that I set you up.,Client,anger,undefined
That way we can both have what we want-,Client,anger,undefined
"I can be mad at you, and you can be done with me.",Client,anger,undefined
Here's where you tell me how relieved I'll be when you walk out the door.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And then you're going to say,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"that you're like a knife in my neck, that it'll feel good when you're gone.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"That how it goes, isn't it?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"See, this is your specialty, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And if you want to keep repeating that pattern, that's fine. Go ahead.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But if you want to make a change in your life,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I suggest that you stay in therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
And it doesn't even need to be with me.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Can we talk about your patterns?,Client,neutral,undefined
My patterns?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Like what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How you like to have a woman on the couch,Client,anger,undefined
"who thinks she's in love with you,",Client,anger,undefined
how you get off on that.,Client,anger,undefined
Get off on it?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I've seen how you look at me.,Client,anger,undefined
You hold up that,Client,anger,undefined
"neutral face pretty well, but I see when it slips",Client,anger,undefined
and you're looking at my neck,Client,anger,undefined
or my legs,Client,anger,undefined
or my breasts and you're wondering what it would be like.,Client,anger,undefined
"Come on, paul, you said you'd be honest.",Client,anger,undefined
How about you drop the act?,Client,anger,undefined
You know you'd rather have me as a patient ten some,Client,anger,undefined
hedge fund guy whose bonus has been reduced.,Client,anger,undefined
Don't tell me you haven't had fantasies about us.,Client,anger,undefined
"Crazy chicks are hot in bed, right?",Client,anger,undefined
What's the matter? Am I making you uncomfortable?,Client,anger,undefined
Why don't we just go in the bedroom right now and fuck?,Client,anger,undefined
Or how about on the kitchen counter?,Client,anger,undefined
I bet you never did that with laura.,Client,anger,undefined
"So there's nothing to be learned from therapy,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
so let's just go fuck? Is that it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
At least we'd get some relief,Client,depression,undefined
from our miserable lives.,Client,depression,undefined
So that's your version of closure?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"It would make us feel better, instead of pretending that this",Client,anger,undefined
talking nonsense actually helps.,Client,anger,undefined
"It would make us feel better, instead of pretending that this",Client,anger,undefined
talking nonsense actually helps.,Client,anger,undefined
What would it be like if you broke all the rules for me?,Client,neutral,undefined
You mean if I said,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
yes?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So you want to?,Client,neutral,undefined
What if I do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What would happen?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What are you saying?,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you finally feel special enough?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Would it fix everything, to win like that?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Or would you just blame me for crossing the line?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You're a lawyer, for chrissake.",Therapist,anger,Interpretation
You know what it would mean.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
Then I would be truly guilty of malpractice.,Therapist,anger,Interpretation
You've probably represented doctors like that.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
"Hell of a way to get out of therapy, I have to say",Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
turn me into one of your clients.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
That's not what I'm doing.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
Isn't it? Then I would need you.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
You would be in control.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
"And that would be much more comfortable for you,",Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
to have me back in your office.,Therapist,anger,Self-disclosure
Maybe,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
maybe that's why you really do it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
Your job.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're changing the topic.,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you getting scared?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm trying to help you. That's my job.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"What's yours, mia? What do you do at work every day?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You know as well as anyone what I do.,Client,neutral,undefined
How is your case going?,Client,neutral,undefined
I wasn't in last week. Don't you have a hearing coming up?,Client,neutral,undefined
So they tell me.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But you're right, you weren't in last week.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"If you had gone in, what cases would you have been working on?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
No trials. I was supposed to meet a new client,Client,neutral,undefined
a pediatrician who,Client,neutral,undefined
"misdiagnosed some nine-year-old kid,",Client,neutral,undefined
almost killed him.,Client,neutral,undefined
No wonder you stayed in bed.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I don't judge my clients, paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
I protect them.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how many of your clients are powerful men,Therapist,neutral,Open question
who fail to protect the vulnerable and the innocent?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"They're being sued, paul,",Client,neutral,undefined
just like you. That doesn't mean they're guilty.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how long have you been doing that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
17 years.,Client,neutral,undefined
How often do you call in sick?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Since I got there?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Five days, four.",Client,neutral,undefined
In 17 years?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And vacations?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You don't lose the weeks if you don't take them.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I see. But last week,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"after confronting your father, you didn't go in.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"According to you, I was depressed.",Client,neutral,undefined
I think you were.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I don't think it's a coincidence,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that suddenly you didn't want to defend somebody whose negligence,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
had harmed a child.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Look, I'm not saying they're all guilty,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"but every time you stand in that courtroom to defend a client,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I think you're actually defending your father to everybody,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
especially yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Shit.,Client,anger,undefined
How long have you known that one?,Client,anger,undefined
Does it make sense to you?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I never made the connexion...,Client,depression,undefined
and now I'm stuck with it.,Client,depression,undefined
I never made the connexion...,Client,depression,undefined
and now I'm stuck with it.,Client,depression,undefined
I felt like I had nothing before. Now I have less than nothing.,Client,depression,undefined
I know it feels scary,Therapist,neutral,Approval
but maybe that's a good thing.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's a good thing that I have nothing?,Client,anger,undefined
Thank you.,Client,anger,undefined
Thank you. You've helped me to realize that I've made,Client,anger,undefined
poor choice after poor choice my whole life.,Client,anger,undefined
"But you also have to realize, Mia,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"that you're at a critical juncture in your life,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
that now you do have the self-knowledge,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"to make different, better choices.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Don't give me any of this Pollyanna shit.,Client,anger,undefined
"And sometimes when you're on the verge of real change,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
that's when you fight the hardest.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
When you first came back I tried to ask you,Therapist,neutral,Approval
about your connection to your father,Therapist,neutral,Approval
and you shut me down. You didn't want to know anything about it.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
This past week you confronted him.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, look how well that worked out.",Client,anger,undefined
I'm not saying it was easy. But maybe it's worth it.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"To finally take off the blinders,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
even if you don't like what you see. Because what is the alternative?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Put them back on again and wander around in the darkness?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Did you have to take them off? I didn't do it. You did.,Client,anger,undefined
Did you have to take them off? I didn't do it. You did.,Client,anger,undefined
What are you thinking?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing.,Client,depression,undefined
What am I going to do with the rest of my life?,Client,depression,undefined
I want...,Client,depression,undefined
the same things I wanted when I came here two months ago...,Client,depression,undefined
"a man, a home, a family.",Client,depression,undefined
I'm no closer to getting them.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you really think that getting married is going to make it all better?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Do you have any idea of how many married people,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
how many parents feel as empty as you do?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Let me ask you...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
when was the last time you felt real happiness?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
A couple weeks ago when I thought that I was pregnant.,Client,depression,undefined
A couple weeks ago when I thought that I was pregnant.,Client,depression,undefined
And what about that made you feel good?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That it wasn't just me, that my life had meaning,",Client,depression,undefined
that there would be,Client,depression,undefined
"this other person, always.",Client,depression,undefined
"Have you ever considered that maybe it's not about a child, Mia,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or a husband?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe that's just a picture in your head,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"from your family, from your friends,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
from the culture.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Not everyone needs that,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to live a full and contented life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Maybe what you really want, Mia, is to feel connected,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
authentically connected,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to somebody or something else.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And we both know that I can't have that.,Client,anger,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
An authentic connection? Me?,Client,anger,undefined
I've never had that. I'm incapable.,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you sure?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What about in here?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are you kidding me?,Client,anger,undefined
I'm a mess in here.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm a mess in here.,Client,anger,undefined
I attack you. I've dumped on you. I've tried to seduce you.,Client,anger,undefined
I've been a train wreck.,Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, at times you have acted out.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But if you hadn't, how could we examine it?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's been your way of communicating to both of us what you need.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You've also been honest,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
caring. You've made yourself vulnerable.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You've shown me who you really are.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And you haven't walked away.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Yet.,Client,neutral,undefined
We both know that you really want to change.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
That's the real reason you keep coming back.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yes, of course you want intimacy in your life.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
And I know...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I know that you're capable of that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Because we've had it.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
When? Name one time.,Client,anger,undefined
Now. Right now.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Our time is up, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Thank you, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
It was a good session.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Goodbye, Mia.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So...,Client,neutral,undefined
I guess I'll see you next week.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'll be here.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm sorry about earlier.,Client,neutral,undefined
It happens.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I didn't realize how many fellow patients there were.,Client,joy,undefined
"You're busy all the time, aren't you?",Client,joy,undefined
So they...,Client,neutral,undefined
finally released me Monday afternoon.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you for your help.,Client,neutral,undefined
Connie and Natalie picked me up.,Client,neutral,undefined
We headed straight out for the bay.,Client,neutral,undefined
I have a few shacks there...,Client,neutral,undefined
that Connie likes to call a compound... on Shelter Island.,Client,neutral,undefined
"We drove up... a warm day,",Client,joy,undefined
first southerly wind of the new year.,Client,joy,undefined
It was a beautiful day on Monday.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It's amazing when the cold finally,Therapist,neutral,Approval
breaks.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Everything was so muddy, though.",Client,neutral,undefined
They're a few weeks behind the city Weatherwise.,Client,neutral,undefined
The snow had just melted,Client,neutral,undefined
and the ground was just soaked.,Client,neutral,undefined
I imagine it felt good to be...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"outside, especially after the last few weeks.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You could say that. But...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
it didn't?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, no, the air felt great.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's just that...,Client,disgust,undefined
Connie and Natalie... They were just so...,Client,disgust,undefined
tentative with me.,Client,disgust,undefined
There's a separate studio near the main house,Client,disgust,undefined
"that I've used as an office sometimes, or sometimes just to...",Client,disgust,undefined
for a little peace and quiet when the kids were younger.,Client,disgust,undefined
I wanted to go there but they kept asking me why.,Client,disgust,undefined
Was there anything you needed to do in your office?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, take care of some bills.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, take care of some bills.",Client,disgust,undefined
But mostly I just wanted to be by myself.,Client,disgust,undefined
I just wanted to have a little peace.,Client,disgust,undefined
That's unusual for you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Well, Connie's a talker... She's always been a talker...",Client,disgust,undefined
and I guess over the years I've learned how to tune it out.,Client,disgust,undefined
But this time you didn't.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Something about her pitch... It just bothered me.,Client,disgust,undefined
"So I went to the office,",Client,disgust,undefined
and a few minutes later I looked up,Client,disgust,undefined
and there's Natalie spying on me from her bedroom window.,Client,disgust,undefined
She's still...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She's still on duty.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, like I was a little boy that someone had to babysit.",Client,neutral,undefined
You told me once,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"that when you were a little boy yourself,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you were the one on duty with your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I didn't do that much,",Client,disgust,undefined
just kept an eye on things. Really it's nothing even worth talking about.,Client,disgust,undefined
So what did you do when you saw Natalie,Therapist,neutral,Open question
keeping an eye on you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I glared.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then about minutes later she brought me some tea,Client,neutral,undefined
which I hadn't asked for.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she asked if she could just sit with me.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how was that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Brief.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's my daughter. I don't go to her with my problems.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You have a good relationship with her, though.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You wrote to her almost every day when she was in Rwanda.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I imagine she'd worry less if you talked to her a little bit more,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
about what's been going on with you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I just didn't feel like talking.",Client,disgust,undefined
So I went to the shed,Client,neutral,undefined
"and got this immense pair of clippers and,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I started hacking away at the brush down by the water,",Client,neutral,undefined
limbing the trees and paring down the bushes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"God, tore my hands up something terrible.",Client,neutral,undefined
All that brush-clearing...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
it's kind of like what we've been doing in here.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You lost me on that one.,Client,neutral,undefined
"In the sense that we've been working on clearing paths,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
opening up your view of how you got to where you are.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"So when you mentioned this week's thaw,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
it made me think of the way our last session ended.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You know,",Client,neutral,undefined
"between the pills and the therapists I saw at the hospital,",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not sure I even remember that one.,Client,neutral,undefined
You really don't remember?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I find that striking,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
given how emotional a moment that was.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, I know we talked about getting me out of the cuckoo's nest.",Client,neutral,undefined
And I showed you my pot holder.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then I got angry about you bringing up Connie's rehab.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I meant after that, when we talked about the two Walters...",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
the one who you knew and the one you didn't know.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
That's right.,Client,neutral,undefined
You seemed quite moved,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
when we talked about reconnecting to the lost Walter.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, I might have teared up a bit,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I was tired and there's been,Client,neutral,undefined
a lot of stress.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I understand that,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
but my memory is that you didn't just tear up.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You were actually sobbing.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"What is it, Walter?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Where did you go?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I just remembered a dream I had this week.,Client,sadness,undefined
I just remembered a dream I had this week.,Client,sadness,undefined
Mr. Donaldson called me in for a meeting.,Client,sadness,undefined
Only it wasn't in an office.,Client,sadness,undefined
It was...,Client,sadness,undefined
It was in an old garage.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I went in,",Client,sadness,undefined
we shook hands,Client,sadness,undefined
and he told me they'd traced,Client,sadness,undefined
the source of the contamination and that it wasn't anything we'd done wrong.,Client,sadness,undefined
Some nut job deliberately tampering with the product,Client,sadness,undefined
and then putting it back on shelf.,Client,sadness,undefined
Go on.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I felt vindicated. And then,",Client,sadness,undefined
the old man did something he never did...,Client,sadness,undefined
he apologized.,Client,sadness,undefined
He said that letting go of me,Client,sadness,undefined
"was the biggest mistake he'd ever made,",Client,sadness,undefined
that he wanted me to take my old job back.,Client,sadness,undefined
"You'd be Walter Barnett, C.E.O. again.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I tried to answer,",Client,sadness,undefined
but I couldn't speak.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I opened my mouth,",Client,sadness,undefined
but I couldn't get any words out.,Client,sadness,undefined
I woke up in a sweat.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I kept trying to dive back into the dream, but I couldn't get there.",Client,sadness,undefined
You wanted to finish the conversation?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What did you make of that dream?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Well, I guess I still want to think the whole mess never happened.",Client,sadness,undefined
"Well, I guess I still want to think the whole mess never happened.",Client,sadness,undefined
I want my old life back.,Client,sadness,undefined
Do you?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Because you said you couldn't get any words out.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is it possible that you weren't sure if you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
wanted to go back?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Probably just bargaining.,Client,neutral,undefined
Could be.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Or perhaps now with a little distance,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you have a greater sense of the enormous strain,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you've been under for so long.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It never used to feel like a strain.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's right.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I think you genuinely didn't feel it.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You've become exceptionally adept at overriding your feelings.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That's what we were beginning to talk about last week.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you remember?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Right,",Client,neutral,undefined
how the weak Walter couldn't handle the stress.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you think about that,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Walter this week?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
The lost boy?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, not really.",Client,neutral,undefined
You did make me think about my father.,Client,neutral,undefined
Your father?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How did I do that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Just before, when I came early and I walked in on you,",Client,depression,undefined
you just had a look on your face that reminded me of him.,Client,depression,undefined
In what way?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
After Tommy...,Client,depression,undefined
"after the accident,",Client,depression,undefined
he couldn't sleep nights anymore.,Client,depression,undefined
Insomnia?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, and he started to work the graveyard shift.",Client,depression,undefined
And,Client,depression,undefined
"when he'd come home from the factory,",Client,depression,undefined
"he didn't want to wake up my mother,",Client,depression,undefined
so he'd go to sleep on the couch.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I'd come downstairs and I'd want to talk to him, you know, about...",Client,depression,undefined
I don't know...,Client,depression,undefined
"the day before, what happened at school.",Client,depression,undefined
And there was that look.,Client,depression,undefined
Can you describe it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How the hell do I get rid of you,Client,depression,undefined
without making you feel bad?,Client,depression,undefined
"Come on, listen, it's okay. Really, you were busy.",Client,depression,undefined
"If it had been my session and somebody walked in, I would have been pissed off.",Client,depression,undefined
"Still, you felt rejected, even abandoned.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I was early.,Client,depression,undefined
"Right, the same way you were too early for your dad.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Work comes first.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's life.,Client,neutral,undefined
My mother didn't see much of him either.,Client,neutral,undefined
She got used to it.,Client,neutral,undefined
She'd come home from the hospital... she was a nurse...,Client,neutral,undefined
and I'd fix her an old-fashioned.,Client,joy,undefined
We'd eat.,Client,joy,undefined
I'd fix her another.,Client,joy,undefined
I had to get the cherry and the orange wedge just right.,Client,joy,undefined
Then she'd go in her bedroom.,Client,joy,undefined
I was always nervous that,Client,neutral,undefined
"she'd fall asleep while she was smoking in bed,",Client,neutral,undefined
so I'd check in on her,Client,neutral,undefined
and make sure all the ashtrays were out.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's a lot of responsibility for a young boy.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Listen, they were...",Client,depression,undefined
you can't blame her...,Client,depression,undefined
either of them.,Client,depression,undefined
Their lives were ruined.,Client,depression,undefined
There's any need to blame them,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
in order to understand your loneliness.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
They were too grief-stricken to take care of me.,Client,depression,undefined
I had to put away my childish things.,Client,depression,undefined
"Actually, I think the verse is, When I became a man,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I put away childish things.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You were still a boy.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
A lot of kids had it worse.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you remember any good times?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Did the three of you spend time together?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Not so much.,Client,depression,undefined
On weekends he was always tinkering with his car.,Client,depression,undefined
That thing was a real money pit.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you have a garage?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
I used to peek in on him.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he didn't let you in?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
After a while I figured out,Client,neutral,undefined
how to stand on a garbage can and look through the window.,Client,neutral,undefined
It turned out...,Client,depression,undefined
most of the time he wasn't working on the car.,Client,depression,undefined
He was...,Client,sadness,undefined
staring at a picture of Tommy on the wall.,Client,sadness,undefined
One time he saw me.,Client,sadness,undefined
It was terrible.,Client,sadness,undefined
"You wanted to connect with him, but you felt",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
he didn't want you there. Is that it?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
The boys used to spy on me the same way...,Client,depression,undefined
when I worked on weekends.,Client,depression,undefined
They'd want to play or...,Client,depression,undefined
"go swimming, and...",Client,depression,undefined
I always had work to do.,Client,depression,undefined
I probably gave them the same look.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe that's why we don't have anything to talk about now.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, it's not too late for you to get to know them",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
and for them to get to know you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't think they'd be interested.,Client,depression,undefined
"Maybe they feel,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I don't know, intimidated by you.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Repairing those relationships is something that we can work on in here.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I said I don't think they're interested.,Client,anger,undefined
You were interested in talking to your father...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
about what you saw in that garage.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"In fact, you're still dreaming about it.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
We never discussed it.,Client,neutral,undefined
A few years later we moved...,Client,neutral,undefined
to the next coal town over.,Client,neutral,undefined
"My mother didn't want to go, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
my father thought it would be better,Client,neutral,undefined
to start over again in a new place without...,Client,neutral,undefined
Tommy's presence hovering over everything.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how did you feel about it?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
They didn't ask me.,Client,depression,undefined
"It must be hard, as a child,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
to know what your feelings are when you're not asked about them.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
For awhile there after we moved...,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd run away...,Client,neutral,undefined
back to the old home.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd get on my bike and...,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'd just go there, I don't know...",Client,neutral,undefined
to check if Tommy was waiting for us.,Client,neutral,undefined
Go figure out a child.,Client,neutral,undefined
What would you do when you visited?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'd just sit there for hours, waiting.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He never came back, of course.",Client,neutral,undefined
I wonder if maybe...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you didn't go back...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
just to look for Tommy. Maybe there was someone else you were looking for.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Who?,Client,neutral,undefined
The boy that you were before Tommy was killed.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe the old house was...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the only place you could let yourself,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
feel your losses and...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"find intimacy with something that was gone, with your...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
with your dead brother and...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
your memories.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"There was nothing there for you, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And there was nothing in the new home except...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"duty, loneliness.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Don't worry.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not gonna cry.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know how uncomfortable that made you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Is that how you thought I reacted, Walter, to last week?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Come on.,Client,depression,undefined
You don't need to pretend.,Client,depression,undefined
I know I've been a basket case in here.,Client,depression,undefined
I know how that disgusted you.,Client,depression,undefined
Why would I feel like that?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm a grown man.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not a six-year-old.,Client,neutral,undefined
And... men don't cry.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Maybe they do now. But...,Client,neutral,undefined
"when I became a man, they didn't.",Client,neutral,undefined
Was that what your father taught you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He didn't have to.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Where I grew up, a boy wouldn't be caught dead crying.",Client,neutral,undefined
How about when Tommy died?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Did you cry then?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I was upset.,Client,depression,undefined
I knew it was my fault.,Client,depression,undefined
I knew it was my fault.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe I started to tremble.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe I started to cry.,Client,depression,undefined
"Because the old man, I remember, picked me up and...",Client,depression,undefined
shook me... hard.,Client,depression,undefined
"Don't you dare, he said,",Client,depression,undefined
in front of your mother.,Client,depression,undefined
Don't...,Client,depression,undefined
you...,Client,depression,undefined
ever.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think that's when you started to maybe...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
shut down a little?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You mean...,Client,neutral,undefined
that other Walter of yours?,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe it's not really fair to call him the other Walter.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"The truth is, he's a part of you.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
A part of you that was split off and neglected...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for a very long time.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I was doing fine without him,Client,neutral,undefined
"all this time, wasn't I?",Client,neutral,undefined
You did more than fine.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You accomplished great things in your life, Walter.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

"It can be hard to live your life,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"to be genuinely fulfilled,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
when a part of your...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
your true self is locked away.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think that what happened was that the other part of you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"the part that took responsibility,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that shouldered all these burdens...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that's the part that got rewarded...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
early and often.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

We were always walking on eggshells.,Client,depression,undefined
My father and I didn't even tell her I was going to Vietnam until...,Client,depression,undefined
two or three days before I left.,Client,depression,undefined
And you were...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
a hero in Vietnam as well.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
James Donaldson was the hero.,Client,depression,undefined
I just did my part.,Client,depression,undefined
But I'm sure you were a natural leader.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And... in the chaos of the war,Therapist,neutral,Approval
people must have looked to you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And they were right to do so. You'd been trained,Therapist,neutral,Approval
from an early age to step up.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It helped me survive.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's always helped you survive.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Even thrive.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's how you rose to the top of your field.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Except that...,Therapist,neutral,Open question

you just don't think you're of any value to anybody,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
unless you're in that role.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Now that you've launched them, your boys...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
don't want to get to know you. Natalie was done with you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't want to see you at the door.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The only way to feel not rejected...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is to carry the weight...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation

are screaming at you to stop.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I've stopped now, haven't I?",Client,depression,undefined
"I've stopped now, haven't I?",Client,depression,undefined
"Walter Barnett, the C.E.O...",Client,depression,undefined
he's gone.,Client,depression,undefined
He came to you with a sleeping problem...,Client,depression,undefined
and within weeks his life was in shambles.,Client,depression,undefined
I think we both understand,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that by the time you came to see me there was no way to prevent the crash.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You knew I was headed for this?,Client,disgust,undefined
The Walter you knew...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
the hero...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
he staved it off as long as humanly possible.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
If he could have held it together this time...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
he would have.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Well, it doesn't matter either way, does it?",Client,depression,undefined
We both know what you're telling me.,Client,depression,undefined
What is that?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I missed it.,Client,depression,undefined
What did you miss?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
My life.,Client,depression,undefined
Isn't that what you're saying?,Client,depression,undefined
I'm 68 years old...,Client,depression,undefined
and I haven't lived one moment of my life,Client,depression,undefined
for myself.,Client,depression,undefined
What the hell am I supposed to do with that?,Client,anger,undefined
Are you going to say anything?,Client,anger,undefined
Just that I think that now is the time,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"to stop taking care of everybody else, Walter,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
and start reconnecting...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
to yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Was this your plan all along?,Client,anger,undefined
To break me down so that I'd become dependent on you?,Client,anger,undefined
This would not have been my conscious choice for you,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
any more than it was yours.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
But the defenses that held you together your whole life...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
They just finally wore out.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You have two choices now.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
We can try to wrap you back up.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Work on simple behavioral changes.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
And you and I can both talk to your psychopharmacologist...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
get you back to managing things the way you always have.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
It's a valid approach.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Or?,Client,neutral,undefined
There's a more challenging route.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"If we can keep going,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"doing the work that we do, even at this stage of your life...",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I know that you can achieve,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
a new way of being...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"with Connie, with Natalie and the boys,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
but most importantly...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
with yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
And we can keep exploring those parts of yourself,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
that we've just begun to discover.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"I'm an old dog, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
70 isn't old.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
It will take work...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
genuine...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
introspection.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And you'll have to come more often.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You really want to spend a couple more hours a week with...,Client,depression,undefined
an old man?,Client,depression,undefined
I wouldn't offer it,Therapist,neutral,Approval
if I didn't think it was worth your time...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
and mine.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Why is it worth your time?,Client,depression,undefined
Because you've rescued so many others...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I want to be there when you go back and...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
rescue yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
Fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
When do we start?,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you going out?,Client,neutral,undefined
You look great.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'd ask you where you were going,Client,neutral,undefined
but I know that you have your boundaries as a therapist.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, I hate to do this, I hate it when my patients do it,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I've asked my lawyer to call me about the hearing.,Client,neutral,undefined
And...,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd rather be,Client,neutral,undefined
here,Client,neutral,undefined
"if it's bad news, okay?",Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I was so relieved that you didn't ask for the letter.,Client,neutral,undefined
I decided not to send it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I was having lunch",Client,neutral,undefined
with the kids last Sunday and Rosie actually asked me about the case.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I told her about the settlement offer,Client,neutral,undefined
"and she said, Dad, you can't do this.",Client,neutral,undefined
You can't confess to something you didn't do.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're the good guy.,Client,neutral,undefined
She'd been so rude to me all night about other stuff.,Client,neutral,undefined
I guess she's still angry about the divorce.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And then suddenly in one sentence, she made me feel better",Client,neutral,undefined
than I'd felt all week.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm glad.,Client,neutral,undefined
So then I called my lawyer and I said I wasn't interested,Client,neutral,undefined
"in the settlement,",Client,neutral,undefined
which meant they went through with the hearing,Client,neutral,undefined
this morning.,Client,neutral,undefined
So how did that go?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know yet. I wasn't there.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The lawyer said technically, I didn't have to be.",Client,neutral,undefined
You didn't go?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I overslept.,Client,neutral,undefined
And why do you think you chose this morning to oversleep?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, the subconscious thing.",Client,neutral,undefined
Probably because I didn't want to go.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I just didn't feel like begging some judge to let me keep my job.,Client,neutral,undefined
You felt showing up would be begging?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
So why are you dressed up?,Client,neutral,undefined
I want to hear about your life.,Client,neutral,undefined
You want to hear about my life?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You don't wanna talk about your own life?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Exactly.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd rather talk about how your lawyer felt the hearing went.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Did he say anything?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, he said not to quote him...",Client,neutral,undefined
'cause these guys hate to be quoted,Client,neutral,undefined
but he said that he thought,Client,neutral,undefined
that it went well.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did he say when you'd find out?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Anytime between today and God-knows-when.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you're in limbo.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Caught between heaven and hell,",Client,neutral,undefined
waiting for my fate,Client,neutral,undefined
"to be decided, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
That must be what this whole year has felt like to you.,Client,neutral,undefined
You've been under enormous pressure.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that why you dressed up?,Client,joy,undefined
That blue looks really really good on you.,Client,joy,undefined
It's the same color as the dress you had on that night,Client,joy,undefined
I saw you and David coming out of that club on the eastern shore.,Client,joy,undefined
It was the 4th of July.,Client,joy,undefined
I remember.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I had,Client,joy,undefined
this crummy summer job.,Client,joy,undefined
"And I was parking cars,",Client,joy,undefined
and...,Client,joy,undefined
I brought out the wrong car,Client,joy,undefined
and he asked me to go back and get his convertible.,Client,joy,undefined
"And I looked at him and I thought,",Client,joy,undefined
Of course. Why wouldn't she be with him?,Client,joy,undefined
"Yeah, we had a wonderful dinner and we danced.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And then we came outside and there was my most dedicated graduate student.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
We were all so in love with you.,Client,joy,undefined
Don't be silly.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How could we not be?,Client,joy,undefined
"You were brilliant,",Client,joy,undefined
and we believed everything you said.,Client,joy,undefined
What are you talking about? You argued with everything that I said.,Therapist,joy,Restatement
"Yeah, but you made us do that. That was your technique.",Client,joy,undefined
We were so fascinated by you.,Client,joy,undefined
We wanted to know,Client,joy,undefined
everything about you.,Client,joy,undefined
What's happening with you today?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What is it you don't wanna talk about?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"What happened here between us last week,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"or your case, or your patients,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
your children?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"No, none of the above.",Client,depression,undefined
Can you tell me what it is?,Client,depression,undefined
It's my lawyer.,Client,depression,undefined
Are you sure you want me to stay?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Please.,Client,depression,undefined
"Hello, Ellis.",Client,neutral,undefined
I just spoke with your judge.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've got news.,Client,neutral,undefined
What sort of news?,Client,neutral,undefined
"First off, he was livid.",Client,neutral,undefined
At me?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No,",Client,neutral,undefined
"at Mr. Prince, for wasting everybody's time.",Client,neutral,undefined
"The judge hasn't written the ruling yet, and he said not to quote him,",Client,neutral,undefined
but there are no triable issues of fact.,Client,neutral,undefined
What?,Client,joy,undefined
"He said it's a tragic story,",Client,neutral,undefined
but he's going to dismiss the action.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's throwing the case out!,Client,neutral,undefined
"Are you saying it's over, Ellis?",Client,joy,undefined
I'm glad for you.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know this thing was a weight.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Thank you so much, you know.",Client,joy,undefined
I really appreciate everything that you've done.,Client,joy,undefined
And...,Client,joy,undefined
"I know I haven't been the easiest person in the world to deal with,",Client,joy,undefined
but I just wanted to say,Client,joy,undefined
thank you.,Client,joy,undefined
Nobody's nice when they're being sued.,Client,neutral,undefined
The important thing is justice was served.,Client,neutral,undefined
Come see me next week. We'll go over it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But tonight, you go out and celebrate. You hear me?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah. Thanks, Ellis.",Client,joy,undefined
Good bye.,Client,joy,undefined
I'm so happy for you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"My God, it's amazing.",Client,joy,undefined
I'm so glad this judge could see what the truth was.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
How long do you think it's gonna be before I really...,Client,joy,undefined
before I really feel it?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Before you wake up some morning not thinking about it?,Client,joy,undefined
Or not go to bed some night without thinking about it.,Client,joy,undefined
That's so great.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Now you know you can keep your practice.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
What are you gonna do?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You were in limbo about that last week as well.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How did you do with your patients this week? Was it hard to see them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I did what you said.,Client,neutral,undefined
I acted as if I believed,Client,neutral,undefined
I really was helping.,Client,neutral,undefined
And did that help?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"To be honest,",Client,neutral,undefined
I was kind of skeptical at first.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I felt a bit like a hypocrite,",Client,neutral,undefined
and that they'd see that.,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course you'd feel that way.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But then weirdly enough, something started to happen.",Client,neutral,undefined
I was talking to Oliver's dad,Client,neutral,undefined
about the responsibility,Client,neutral,undefined
of what it means to be a father and keeping in touch,Client,neutral,undefined
with your kid.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Really, I was talking for both of us.",Client,neutral,undefined
But I think I reached him.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, I was still doubting myself,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but I just kept at it, you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
I just couldn't believe that something so simple could actually...,Client,neutral,undefined
could actually work.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And it kept working, you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
You're a good therapist.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I'm sure you did a lot of good work this week,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
despite how uncertain you felt.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
April left.,Client,depression,undefined
Therapy?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
In part because I took her to chemo.,Therapist,depression,Open question
"I don't regret it,",Client,depression,undefined
but it did,Client,depression,undefined
alter our relationship.,Client,depression,undefined
Of course.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"But also,",Client,neutral,undefined
I think she just needed to stop thinking about herself.,Client,neutral,undefined
She wanted some...,Client,neutral,undefined
space.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She wanted to breathe,",Client,neutral,undefined
to live.,Client,neutral,undefined
And did you try to convince her to stay?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Of course I did.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm worried that she doesn't have the tools to survive another crisis.,Client,depression,undefined
"But part of me, I have to say, is really proud of her.",Client,depression,undefined
For rejecting you?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
For rejecting therapy.,Client,depression,undefined
"I meant, for acting out against you.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"That's not what she was doing, though.",Client,neutral,undefined
She wasn't punishing me,Client,neutral,undefined
or her parents.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's fighting cancer.,Client,neutral,undefined
She needs all of her energy for that.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you were able to accept that?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I was surprised,Client,neutral,undefined
by my reaction.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I know I have this need to rescue,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I really understood her reasoning,Client,neutral,undefined
completely.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, Walter and April,",Client,neutral,undefined
they both think that the world is supposed,Client,neutral,undefined
to be,Client,neutral,undefined
"on their shoulders,",Client,neutral,undefined
and they're both incapable of receiving,Client,neutral,undefined
support.,Client,neutral,undefined
"One's stopping therapy,",Client,neutral,undefined
the other wants more sessions.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you're going to continue.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You know what I realized this week?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Practicing this way, I may never know whether I help people or not.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's not like I'm trying to get them to pass their driving test,Client,neutral,undefined
or do better on their SATs or something.,Client,neutral,undefined
The only measure I have of whether I'm helping somebody or not,Client,neutral,undefined
is how my patients feel about it,Client,neutral,undefined
and how their lives,Client,neutral,undefined
go on from there.,Client,neutral,undefined
And they won't know that until long after we've stopped therapy.,Client,neutral,undefined
What are you saying?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I guess what I'm trying to say is that,Client,neutral,undefined
"these people come to me, they want me to fix their problems,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and the truth is, I think all I can do is just",Client,neutral,undefined
"walk with them for a while, keep them company during a rough patch.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't think anybody's life can be figured out,",Client,neutral,undefined
but it is in our nature to keep trying to make sense of it.,Client,neutral,undefined
And sometimes we can use help.,Client,neutral,undefined
"That's when, if we're lucky, there's somebody in the room",Client,neutral,undefined
who can listen.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It doesn't have to be somebody perfect, somebody...",Client,neutral,undefined
sufficiently screwed up to actually get what we might be going through.,Client,neutral,undefined
Someone like you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
On occasion.,Client,neutral,undefined
And not someone like me.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
Not for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Not anymore.,Client,neutral,undefined
When did you come to this conclusion?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
Please don't take this personally.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"No, I'm not taking it personally.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You know, I'm just...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm just disappointed that we're here again.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I know.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know.,Client,neutral,undefined
But it is different this time.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not doing this,Client,neutral,undefined
in anger.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I appreciate everything that you've done for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I want you to know that.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Let's not drag it out, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined
"After last week, really, what is there to say?",Client,neutral,undefined
I understand. I just want to be sure you're aware,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
of why you're doing what you're doing.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What is it you think I'm not aware of?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Obviously, last week took a toll, a big toll",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"you know, on both of us,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I know that I crossed a line,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
but you also lost two patients this week.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I know.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, has it occurred to you",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"that you're angry at them for abandoning you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and that may be why you've decided to abandon me?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"That's a little reductive, isn't it?",Client,neutral,undefined
"No,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
but this is:,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"you began the week questioning your value as a therapist,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
and you're ending it questioning mine.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm not questioning you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm questioning the way we interact, you and I.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't think it's healthy for either of us.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You're always questioning me,",Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
blaming me.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
I think I've come to represent,Therapist,sadness,Interpretation
everything you struggle with in your work...,Therapist,sadness,Interpretation
"Emotional restraint, delayed gratification,",Therapist,sadness,Interpretation
not indulging your love or your desire for a patient.,Therapist,sadness,Interpretation
You've made me your boundary cop...,Therapist,sadness,Interpretation
The mentor who's prevented you from having anything you ever wanted.,Therapist,sadness,Interpretation
And I beat you up for that.,Client,neutral,undefined
It must have been exhausting to have,Client,neutral,undefined
to play my mother all these years.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If I came running to you, it was because I needed my mother.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If was angry at you, it was because I was angry at my mother.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Honestly, I don't know how you put up with it.",Client,neutral,undefined
"But you did, and you got me through it.",Client,neutral,undefined
"All I'm saying is, you don't have to do it anymore.",Client,neutral,undefined
You're releasing me now.,Therapist,sadness,Self-disclosure
"Yes, I am.",Client,depression,undefined
"You know, Paul,",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"if you need to go, you go.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
But I'm concerned that you may be punishing me,Client,neutral,undefined
because I failed to protect you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But you didn't fail me, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
This has been my sanctuary.,Client,neutral,undefined
"All the parts of myself that I don't like, that I'm ashamed of...",Client,neutral,undefined
"I could bring them here, and it was always okay.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think there's a connection between the lawsuit ending,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
and your stopping therapy?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
It's just time.,Client,neutral,undefined
The things I needed for so long have changed.,Client,neutral,undefined
I can't keep coming to you,Client,neutral,undefined
"for the mothering I didn't get,",Client,neutral,undefined
and you shouldn't have to provide it.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you're not running away from home?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'd rather think of it as moving out.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm going to make my way in the world.,Client,neutral,undefined
Where will you go?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm not going anywhere.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm still going to keep being a therapist...,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe not all private sessions.,Client,neutral,undefined
Some days I just sit there in the room with a patient and I feel like...,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know... I feel like we're two mice with our...,Client,depression,undefined
legs caught in a glue trap.,Client,depression,undefined
"Oh, god.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's a horrible feeling.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe it's the chair.,Client,depression,undefined
I hate that fucking chair.,Client,depression,undefined
You could get a new one.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I did.,Client,anger,undefined
It felt good in the store. But here's the thing about a chair...,Client,anger,undefined
You never really really know until you've sat in it,Client,anger,undefined
for 40 hours a week for a month...,Client,anger,undefined
"Month in, month out. By then it's too late.",Client,anger,undefined
Do you want to practice standing up?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Maybe I need to be in a group practice, so at least when a patient leaves",Client,neutral,undefined
I could go into the lounge and run into some other people,Client,neutral,undefined
"and talk about politics or books or anything, for Christ's sake.",Client,neutral,undefined
Have you thought about supervising?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't think,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm at a role-model place in my life right now, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
I think you'd be a good supervisor.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I mean, you'd have compassion for your students.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"And the more a supervisor has seen, the more valuable he can be.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm fairly certain at this point that no case would shock or surprise you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
That would make a young therapist feel very safe.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Maybe you're right.,Client,neutral,undefined
The one thing I have figured out...,Client,neutral,undefined
I just need to be with more people.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't need a break from being a therapist.,Client,depression,undefined
I need a break from...,Client,depression,undefined
Just from this.,Client,depression,undefined
You know? I need to stop analyzing,Client,depression,undefined
my life.,Client,depression,undefined
I need to start living it.,Client,depression,undefined
I need you to let me go.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, part of me would love to.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I just worry about the timing.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're still in mourning. You're alone. You're isolated.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You don't have a life outside of your practice.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Are you talking about me or you, Gina?",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm talking about you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Did something else happen this week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What do you mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you meet someone?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why do you think that?,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I did have a conversation this week while I was...,Client,neutral,undefined
I was waiting for a coffee.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was on my way to the subway,Client,neutral,undefined
and,Client,neutral,undefined
she was on her way to the gym.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what did you talk about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I told her she looked like a runner.,Client,neutral,undefined
She said that was the best part about running.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I said...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Do you know this book, The Memory of Running?",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know it.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Neither did she, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
it was just great to stand there and,Client,neutral,undefined
"just talk to her about a book,",Client,neutral,undefined
you know?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I got so excited, I ruined it for her. I told her the whole story.",Client,neutral,undefined
What's the book about?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"It's about redemption,",Client,neutral,undefined
I suppose.,Client,neutral,undefined
And did you make a plan to see this woman again?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Her name is Wendy.,Client,neutral,undefined
We live on the same block.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sure we'll run into each other again.,Client,neutral,undefined
We live on the same block.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sure we'll run into each other again.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you?,Client,neutral,undefined
Me what?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Do you have a date tonight?,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that why you're wearing that dress?,Client,neutral,undefined
I do.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I knew it.,Client,neutral,undefined
So who's the lucky guy?,Client,neutral,undefined
Right.,Client,neutral,undefined
Boundaries,Client,neutral,undefined
until the bitter end.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You're an excellent therapist, Gina.",Client,neutral,undefined
I never would have survived without you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Paul, this is the point where, you know,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm supposed to say My door is always open,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I'm not going to say that.,Client,neutral,undefined
I understand.,Client,neutral,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
our time is up.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Good luck. for her. ,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You shouldn't have.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry. I startled you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh no, not at all.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You're just early.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Oh, annoying habit.",Client,neutral,undefined
I apologize for that.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's fine.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Let me just put these...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Please come in.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So do I look familiar?,Client,neutral,undefined
I...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I mean, I don't go to the movies that often.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Oh, no no, I meant do I look like my sister?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, it's been what, 18 years now",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Since Patricia's been my patient?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Oh, of course.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Why would you remember, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"But yes, I do. I see the family resemblance.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Well, Tricia looks more like our father",Client,neutral,undefined
"And I look like mother, or so people say.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, I didn't even know if you'd agree to see me.",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know the rules.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, if enough time has passed, it's...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Well, as you said, 18 years.",Client,neutral,undefined
And there's no chance that Patricia will be my patient again.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's not... that's not a problem.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then as long as she is comfortable with it...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, it's fine.",Client,neutral,undefined
Not that I need to get her permission. 'cause I'm the big sister.,Client,joy,undefined
"Well, you may not need to ask her permission,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But... but I do.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, of course, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
Did you... did you tell her,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That you'd made an appointment with me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She speaks very highly of you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, she does?",Client,neutral,undefined
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
When you called you said that you'd been having,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Some trouble with remembering your lines,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Some memory problems.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Wait, I called?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I'm back onstage.",Client,joy,undefined
It's been years.,Client,joy,undefined
 night of the iguana. do you know it?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I've seen the ads all over town.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Stars,Client,neutral,undefined
"And, well, former stars, I suppose.",Client,neutral,undefined
Is that how you perceive yourself...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
As a former star?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, is that how you see me?",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
I haven't been here five minutes,Client,neutral,undefined
And already I'm a parody of myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
How so?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, you know, the archetypal actress...",Client,neutral,undefined
enough about me. What do you think about me?,Client,neutral,undefined
This is therapy.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's supposed to be about you.,Client,neutral,undefined
So have you been in therapy before?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I did est back in the day,",Client,neutral,undefined
And later lifespring. You remember all that?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hey, it blew my mind at the time.",Client,neutral,undefined
"It kind of seems silly now, I guess.",Client,neutral,undefined
Let's see. What else?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, later I 12-stepped it for a while",Client,neutral,undefined
But that was mostly because my friends were doing it.,Client,neutral,undefined
I never got past the first step.,Client,neutral,undefined
I had trouble with that whole higher-power thing.,Client,neutral,undefined
What else?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, I was on a film once in Ecuador",Client,neutral,undefined
And I had this session with a real-life shaman.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, that was a trip.",Client,neutral,undefined
"It's unbelievable really, after all that",Client,neutral,undefined
"Alternative counterculture crap,",Client,neutral,undefined
That I would wind up on a couch,Client,neutral,undefined
Like a 19th-century neurotic.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Are you surprised that you,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"As you say, wound up here?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, back when my mother was dying,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, when Patricia was seeing you in Baltimore,",Client,neutral,undefined
You really helped her.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I think my sister felt,Client,neutral,undefined
Like I should be seeing someone too.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you didn't?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, I was so overwhelmed with work.",Client,neutral,undefined
I was racing from one job to the next.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And plus, you know,",Client,neutral,undefined
I've just never been attracted,Client,neutral,undefined
To traditional therapy.,Client,neutral,undefined
It just seemed very...,Client,neutral,undefined
Naked to me...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sitting across from someone, talking,",Client,neutral,undefined
Being scrutinized...,Client,neutral,undefined
A nightmare.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does this feel like a nightmare...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Having to sit here with me now?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, I wouldn't say that.",Client,neutral,undefined
More like a vague anxiety dream.,Client,neutral,undefined
Patricia's right. You're easy to talk to.,Client,neutral,undefined
Patricia's right. You're easy to talk to.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Besides, what can I do? I need help.",Client,neutral,undefined
With your lines.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I have them down verbatim the night before.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then I go into rehearsal and wham... they just disappear,",Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, sometimes in the middle of a sentence.",Client,depression,undefined
I'm talking to another character and I just lose my place.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know where I am in the play.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know what's supposed to happen next.,Client,depression,undefined
I can't even improvise my way out of it.,Client,depression,undefined
So during rehearsal,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How often would you lose your lines?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, once, twice, maybe more.",Client,neutral,undefined
Mm-hmm. Anything about the part,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That makes you feel uncomfortable?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you tend to trip over the same spots...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Certain passages,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Certain scenes that give you trouble?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, one day it's one place,",Client,depression,undefined
And another... the next.,Client,neutral,undefined
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
Ava Gardner played the part in the movie.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you see it?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I think so, years ago.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Are you worried about,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Being compared to Ava Gardner?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh no, I have my own take on it.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'll be fine...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Different, very different.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not afraid.,Client,neutral,undefined
As long as I can learn my fucking lines.,Client,neutral,undefined
So how long have you got?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, two more weeks of rehearsal,",Client,neutral,undefined
Two weeks of preview and then opening.,Client,neutral,undefined
And that's the big night.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"The producers are in a panic,",Client,depression,undefined
"Always hovering,",Client,depression,undefined
Whispering in the director's ear.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think they're whispering about you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I heard a rumor that one of them didn't want me,",Client,anger,undefined
Didn't think I was right for the part.,Client,anger,undefined
"In other words, too old.",Client,anger,undefined
The little prick.,Client,anger,undefined
You're angry with him.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, I'm angry with myself.",Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, it's just not like me. I'm always prepared,",Client,anger,undefined
No matter how much blathering on I have to do.,Client,anger,undefined
I did happy days in London. Do you know it?,Client,anger,undefined
That's right.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, it's really a 90-minute monologue... that play.",Client,anger,undefined
Winnie never stops talking.,Client,anger,undefined
"And I was a quick study. I mean, I nailed it every time.",Client,anger,undefined
Back then I had some help.,Client,depression,undefined
From whom?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, my husband Russell.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He's a European history Professor at Columbia,",Client,neutral,undefined
Kind of a bigwig.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, he used to get a kick out of running lines with me.",Client,joy,undefined
I don't know. Maybe he just liked correcting me.,Client,joy,undefined
He used to lie in bed,Client,joy,undefined
And I'd pace back and forth around the room.,Client,joy,undefined
"He was like some kind of academic drill sergeant,",Client,joy,undefined
"You know, with his glasses down on his nose,",Client,joy,undefined
Doing these ridiculous voices.,Client,joy,undefined
What a ham.,Client,joy,undefined
"Well, now he's a pig.",Client,anger,undefined
So he's not helping you anymore?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, we divorced two years ago.",Client,anger,undefined
Yeah.,Client,anger,undefined
He was boffing one of his graduate students.,Client,anger,undefined
She dumped him six months later.,Client,anger,undefined
But it was enough to finish us off.,Client,anger,undefined
So how long were you married?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
16 years.,Client,depression,undefined
That's quite a long run for someone in my business.,Client,depression,undefined
And did you and Russell have children?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Izzy... short for Isabel.,Client,neutral,undefined
Izzy... short for Isabel.,Client,neutral,undefined
She just turned 15.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how is she coping with the divorce?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Fine, I thought.",Client,neutral,undefined
I tried to change the custody arrangement,Client,neutral,undefined
When I got the play.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, usually",Client,neutral,undefined
We alternate weekends and split up the week.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just thought she could stay with me,Client,neutral,undefined
Full-time while I was in rehearsal,Client,neutral,undefined
Because I'd be home at night.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then she could go to her father's,Client,neutral,undefined
When I was in tech and preview.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she wasn't happy with that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Somebody wasn't happy with that.,Client,anger,undefined
Russell said Izzy felt manipulated by the change.,Client,anger,undefined
"I said let her speak for herself, right?",Client,anger,undefined
"Now she's staying with him full-time,",Client,depression,undefined
Won't answer my calls.,Client,depression,undefined
You sound frustrated.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah well, you have teenage kids.",Client,depression,undefined
You know.,Client,depression,undefined
"Oh, Patricia told me",Client,neutral,undefined
That you were having babies when she saw you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So I figure they must be teenagers by now, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, so I mean, you get it.",Client,neutral,undefined
They're little and cute and affectionate.,Client,anger,undefined
And then they're gangly and resentful,Client,anger,undefined
And they're blasting evil shit about you on Twitter,Client,anger,undefined
And silencing their cell phones when you call.,Client,anger,undefined
"You know, I gave her my old blackberry",Client,anger,undefined
And she uses it against me.,Client,anger,undefined
What kind of things does she write about you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, I don't know. I can't do all that social networking stuff.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's too complicated.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I know. I still have problems with email.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Oh no, that isn't what I meant. I'm not a Luddite.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's just I... it's too public.,Client,neutral,undefined
I would have to have an alias.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, yes yes. Of course, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Anyway, who knows what she's posting or tweeting?",Client,anger,undefined
my mother the diva,Client,anger,undefined
Took another gig and bailed on her responsibilities.,Client,anger,undefined
Send.,Client,anger,undefined
Do you think that's something that might be true...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That you've bailed on your responsibilities?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That you've chosen career over motherhood?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not at all.,Client,anger,undefined
History is being rewritten by Izzy.,Client,anger,undefined
If she only knew how many jobs I passed on,Client,anger,undefined
"To stay home and what, make her a Halloween costume?",Client,anger,undefined
Listen to me.,Client,depression,undefined
I sound so...,Client,depression,undefined
So what?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You must think I'm a terrible person.,Client,depression,undefined
Why would I think that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why did I launch into that?,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know why I started in on that story.,Client,depression,undefined
What were we talking about?,Client,depression,undefined
"Oh, Izzy.",Client,depression,undefined
"Yeah, it's not easy",Therapist,neutral,Approval
To withstand a child's anger or scorn,Client,neutral,undefined
"And just to be there to love them anyway,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Even when they reject you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's very stressful.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think I can withstand,Client,neutral,undefined
A lot worse than team Wiskowitz...,Client,neutral,undefined
That's what I call Russell and Izzy when they gang up on me.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's his last name and hers.,Client,neutral,undefined
I took a pass.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Look,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm sure you know this from Patricia,",Client,neutral,undefined
But when our mother was dying,Client,neutral,undefined
I was doing three or four films a year.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was under a lot of pressure...,Client,neutral,undefined
Both personal and professional.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, I would sometimes fly from the set to the hospital",Client,neutral,undefined
And I would have to be back in makeup by crack of dawn.,Client,neutral,undefined
I never missed a day...,Client,neutral,undefined
Not one.,Client,neutral,undefined
My director friend used to call me t. M.F.C....,Client,neutral,undefined
Tough mother fucking cookie.,Client,neutral,undefined
I can take it.,Client,neutral,undefined
You must have found work then,Therapist,neutral,Approval
To be a useful distraction.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Kept me sane.,Client,neutral,undefined
Only now it's making me crazy.,Client,neutral,undefined
But obviously that was a long time ago.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Back then you probably could,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Handle the stress, the schedule, the jet lag.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But you were much younger then.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yes, I know, but...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah well, I know what you're getting at. And you're wrong.",Client,anger,undefined
What am I getting at?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How would you like it if I sat here,Client,depression,undefined
Implying things about your aging body?,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, certain issues do tend to arise",Client,depression,undefined
"Or not arise, as the case may be, in men of a certain age.",Client,depression,undefined
"That is true, yeah.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's not menopause.,Client,depression,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Good.,Client,neutral,undefined
Seems like I've made you angry.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It was interesting earlier on when you talked about that producer...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
The one who thought you were too old.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That made you angry too.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Is it a sensitive subject for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, it's not for everyone?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, it is for most people, yeah.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Look, I'm sure that you're dating some 25-year-old hottie",Client,neutral,undefined
"Who bops home from the gym and bops you into bed, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Patricia caught a glimpse of your wife,",Client,neutral,undefined
But I don't notice a wedding band.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sounds like you and Patricia talked about me quite a lot.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Does that make you nervous?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, don't worry. She adores you.",Client,neutral,undefined
She said before she met her husband,Client,neutral,undefined
"You were the most wonderful man she had ever met,",Client,neutral,undefined
Quote unquote.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you know she got married?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I didn't.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah, she found someone... Yvan.",Client,neutral,undefined
They met on some fellowship in France.,Client,neutral,undefined
"They used to finish each other's sentences,",Client,neutral,undefined
Sometimes in several languages.,Client,neutral,undefined
Really nice to see her so happy.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But he died, though.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
He had a heart condition.,Client,depression,undefined
And she knew this when she married him.,Client,depression,undefined
She married him anyway.,Client,depression,undefined
That's Patricia...,Client,depression,undefined
Unconditional love.,Client,depression,undefined
My sister is sick.,Client,depression,undefined
She has our mother's disease.,Client,depression,undefined
Mm.,Client,neutral,undefined
What's her prognosis?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Stage IV.,Client,depression,undefined
I see.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How long?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm not sure.,Client,depression,undefined
I wanted to tell you when I called you,Client,depression,undefined
"And then later when I got here, but I couldn't.",Client,neutral,undefined
I understand. It's very hard,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To say that kind of thing.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does she have somebody to talk to?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, is she seeing a therapist?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm just concerned.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
She should be... she should be talking to somebody.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm not sure.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, death runs in the family.",Client,depression,undefined
It's a family disease.,Client,depression,undefined
"If your mother dies of it, watch out.",Client,depression,undefined
You're five times more likely to get it yourself.,Client,depression,undefined
Are you all right?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes yes, I'm fine.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You said it was a family disease.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, there's a genetic test",Client,neutral,undefined
For breast cancer... the brca1.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, I know.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Patricia's obsessed with it...,Client,neutral,undefined
All those miserable statistics.,Client,neutral,undefined
I finally had a mammogram just to shut her up.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was 100% clean. But that's not enough for her.,Client,neutral,undefined
She still wants me to take the test.,Client,neutral,undefined
She harangues me every time she sees me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course I haven't seen her for close to a month.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've been so swamped.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does she still live in Baltimore?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, she moved here years ago.",Client,neutral,undefined
She lives just 15 blocks from here.,Client,neutral,undefined
She hates being sick.,Client,neutral,undefined
She's so confined.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, she used to be so vibrant.",Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
She must have been quite ill,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
When you started rehearsals.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah well, when I took the play",Client,depression,undefined
She was just starting chemo again.,Client,depression,undefined
And when I started rehearsals,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, they had started another round,",Client,depression,undefined
But it wasn't working. So they stopped treatment.,Client,depression,undefined
Why? Are you joining team Wiskowitz?,Client,depression,undefined
You think I shouldn't have taken the play?,Client,depression,undefined
"No, I just think it's worth looking at the reasons",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Why you might have taken the job.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I needed a job. I wanted to take a job.,Client,anger,undefined
I hadn't worked in two years.,Client,anger,undefined
I hadn't had a decent job in longer than that.,Client,anger,undefined
So I grabbed it.,Client,anger,undefined
Does that make me a cold-hearted egomaniac?,Client,anger,undefined
"Look, you've just come through",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
A difficult divorce;,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Your daughter isn't relating to you;,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Your sister is sick;,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
There's a genetic test that you're anxious about...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, I'm not anxious about the fucking test, okay?",Client,anger,undefined
Patricia's the one who's anxious.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, I would imagine that the play",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Provided a kind of an escape...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Escape?,Client,anger,undefined
"No, it's the problem, not the solution.",Client,anger,undefined
What's the problem?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm failing.,Client,anger,undefined
Is it possible that some part of you,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Might be inclined towards failure?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, people sabotage themselves all the time",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
For what they think are very good reasons.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, that's not me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, earlier you were talking about Izzy",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And how angry she is and how she resents you working.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Did you notice during that that you lost your train of thought?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, you did. And it was at a moment",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
When you were judging yourself for being selfish.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm just wondering if you're having a similar judgment,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
About yourself in rehearsal...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You know, about being selfish by being in the play.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"My God, did you aggravate Patricia like this?",Client,anger,undefined
She said you were supremely supportive.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, maybe I've just become more aggravating",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"In my middle years, yeah.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Or maybe she was a nicer patient. I don't know.,Client,anger,undefined
Was she a nicer patient?,Client,neutral,undefined
What if she was a nicer patient...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"A better patient, whatever that might mean?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, I think it's interesting",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That you chose to see me...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Your sister's former therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, as I said, you came highly recommended.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I'm sure that you had recommendations",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
From a lot of people.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Did you ask around?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, not really.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think there might be,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Something particular in coming to see me...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Some special understanding that you might hope,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"To gain about Patricia,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Some insight into her maybe,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Into her relationship with you bef...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
Just say it.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's true.,Client,sadness,undefined
She's dying... Tricia.,Client,sadness,undefined
That's the first time I've said it out loud.,Client,sadness,undefined
Is it time? Because it must be time.,Client,depression,undefined
Oh God.,Client,depression,undefined
"I tell you, rehearsal's gonna be.",Client,depression,undefined
So are you on your way to work?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, I am. Wish me luck.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well,",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Break a leg, as they say.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Oh well, save the superstitions for the performance.",Client,neutral,undefined
This is just a run-through.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, good luck with your run-through then.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Tell the truth... do you always buy fresh flowers for the office,Client,joy,undefined
Or were you just trying to make a good impression?,Client,joy,undefined
I was just passing the bodega,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
And I thought they'd brighten up the place.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
They do.,Client,joy,undefined
And just keep an eye when you're rehearsing,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
If you go up on the lines.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
If?,Client,neutral,undefined
"What up, dawg?",Client,neutral,undefined
What up wit'choo?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Have you been practicing?,Client,neutral,undefined
I appreciate that.,Client,neutral,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
so I took a lot,Client,neutral,undefined
Of really good pictures this week.,Client,neutral,undefined
At least I think they're really good. Do you want to see them?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure. Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I uploaded a lot of them onto Facebook.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I tried to friend you,",Client,neutral,undefined
But then I discovered you're not on Facebook.,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you a libertarian or something?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, Well, then you should get on Facebook.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Our society is becoming increasingly bifurcated.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you know what that means?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Mm-hmm. Yes, I do.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, it was a vocab word this week,",Client,neutral,undefined
And I kinda loved it.,Client,neutral,undefined
I feel I have a real affinity,Client,neutral,undefined

I did have a wife.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
We're divorced now.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
How long 21 years. Were you married?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you miss her?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sometimes I...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yes, I do.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"In Hinduism, when...",Client,neutral,undefined
"When the wife dies before the husband,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Before she is cremated,",Client,neutral,undefined
She is dressed in her red bridal clothes.,Client,neutral,undefined
And now when I see her wedding photo,Client,sadness,undefined
I think of her funeral.,Client,sadness,undefined
She used to tease me,Client,depression,undefined
That in our wedding photo I look like,Client,depression,undefined
I'm entering into a pool,Client,depression,undefined
Containing a giant octopus.,Client,depression,undefined
We were both still very young.,Client,depression,undefined
"And like most brahmin marriages,",Client,depression,undefined
It was arranged.,Client,depression,undefined
I'd just graduated from the university.,Client,depression,undefined
She and her family came over to our home.,Client,depression,undefined
There was a short interview,Client,depression,undefined
Which lasted perhaps two hours.,Client,depression,undefined
And our parents decided,Client,depression,undefined
That we were to be married shortly after that.,Client,depression,undefined
This was going to be my future.,Client,depression,undefined
And when your future walks into the room,Client,depression,undefined
"And sits beside you on the carpet,",Client,depression,undefined
"It could be, you know,",Client,depression,undefined
Quite disconcerting.,Client,depression,undefined
These things work differently in America.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, they are different, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But whether they work is another question.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
In some ways,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
An arranged marriage seems like it might be simpler.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I would say for us it was fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
Only... only fine?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Fine... fine is good.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, perhaps...",Client,neutral,undefined
Perhaps she was my closest friend.,Client,neutral,undefined
How often do you find yourself,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Thinking about kamala?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Many many times each day.,Client,neutral,undefined
Many many times each day.,Client,neutral,undefined
I often think of her when I see Julia.,Client,neutral,undefined
So...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"So when you see Julia,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You're reminded of... of your wife?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of the differences between them.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's... it's impossible not to.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, kamala would not have approved",Client,neutral,undefined
Of the way Julia is raising our grandchildren.,Client,neutral,undefined
What do you mean? Why wouldn't she approve?,Client,neutral,undefined
"She might think that they're spoiled,",Client,neutral,undefined
That there's too little discipline.,Client,neutral,undefined
She might think the minute they don't get what they want,Client,neutral,undefined
"They scream, they throw tantrums.",Client,neutral,undefined
And do you think that's true?,Client,neutral,undefined
Our son was raised differently.,Client,neutral,undefined
Kamala taught him,Client,neutral,undefined
"Good manners, humility,",Client,neutral,undefined
Because it was important to her.,Client,neutral,undefined
And it sounds like it's important to you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Would you say that's true?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can I ask you,Client,neutral,undefined
What else is in your notebook?,Client,neutral,undefined
Many things.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sometimes,Client,neutral,undefined
I write to kamala too.,Client,neutral,undefined
In your notebook?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, very simple things.",Client,neutral,undefined
Like...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Like hello,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Good morning, good night,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Or the sun is very hot today,",Client,neutral,undefined
Or the birds are too loud for sleeping.,Client,neutral,undefined
Things like this.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you ever written to her about your grandchildren?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I tell her that she would be,Client,neutral,undefined
Quite fond of them.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you share your concerns with kamala,Therapist,neutral,Open question
About how Julia,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is raising your grandchildren?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
So can I smoke?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, sure. You can smoke, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Dr. Weston, please call me Sunil.",Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
And you must call me Paul.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Mm-hmm, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
You know what happened this morning?,Client,neutral,undefined
"A plumber came to fix my shower,",Client,neutral,undefined
So I had to use Arun and Julia's bathroom.,Client,neutral,undefined
As I was coming out of the shower...,Client,neutral,undefined
Julia came in.,Client,neutral,undefined
I had the towel wrapped around my waist.,Client,neutral,undefined
She entered just as I was putting,Client,neutral,undefined
A small piece of soap in a dish,Client,neutral,undefined
On top of the toilet tank...,Client,neutral,undefined
A little purple soap goose,Client,neutral,undefined
That smelled of lavender.,Client,neutral,undefined
She was preparing to take the shower too.,Client,neutral,undefined
So she was also in her towel?,Client,neutral,undefined
"She very quickly covered herself with her towel, yes.",Client,neutral,undefined
She froze.,Client,neutral,undefined
She obviously forgot about the plumber.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I said, excuse me",Client,neutral,undefined
And then went up to my room to get dressed.,Client,neutral,undefined
10 minutes later she knocked on my door.,Client,neutral,undefined
What did she say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She became very angry.,Client,anger,undefined
She spoke to me as if I'm a child...,Client,neutral,undefined
Because of soap.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, she'd just been confronted by the fact",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That you're not a child at all.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She may have been covering for other feelings,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That she had from seeing you in this way.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What feelings?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
My daughter-in-law is not,Client,neutral,undefined
"A modest woman, I assure you.",Client,neutral,undefined
My daughter-in-law is not,Client,neutral,undefined
"A modest woman, I assure you.",Client,neutral,undefined
She still showers with Sam even though he's nearly six.,Client,neutral,undefined
For her it's perfectly appropriate.,Client,neutral,undefined
But not to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You are the expert. Please tell me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Where was your son when all of this happened?,Client,neutral,undefined
He had already left for work.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sunil, when Julia was here last week,",Client,neutral,undefined
She mentioned feeling,Client,neutral,undefined
Uncomfortable at times,Client,neutral,undefined
Because of the way that you look at her.,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you say that this encounter,Client,neutral,undefined
In the bathroom,Client,neutral,undefined
Might have been one of those moments?,Client,neutral,undefined
"We were both in our towels, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And I said, excuse me.",Client,neutral,undefined
And I went out.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, I understand that. What I'm asking is...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Can you say a bit more about how you felt,Therapist,neutral,Open question
When your daughter-in-law surprised you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I would say I felt surprised.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, but what else?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I said to myself,",Client,neutral,undefined
"see, here's your daughter-in-law,",Client,neutral,undefined
And she is wearing a towel.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't understand the rules of this house.,Client,anger,undefined
My son and Julia are very different people.,Client,anger,undefined
I used to believe,Client,anger,undefined
"That these differences were what drew him to her,",Client,anger,undefined
Beyond her yellow shining hair.,Client,anger,undefined
And you don't think that anymore?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Now the differences are less and less.,Client,anger,undefined
"He has become more like her,",Client,anger,undefined
As if under a spell.,Client,anger,undefined
I wonder how he feels not being,Client,anger,undefined
The master of his own house.,Client,anger,undefined
That's how you see... you see Arun?,Client,anger,undefined
"He prepares her cappuccino for her every morning,",Client,anger,undefined
And precisely as she wishes too...,Client,anger,undefined
With just the right amount of steamed skim milk,Client,anger,undefined
And one cube of organic brown sugar.,Client,anger,undefined
"He puts the dishes away in the cupboard,",Client,anger,undefined
Gives the children their evening bath,Client,anger,undefined
So that she can read in her study.,Client,anger,undefined
Maybe your son enjoys these activities...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That he makes Julia her cappuccino in the morning,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And puts the dishes away because...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because he wants to.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm not...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm not for a moment dismissing your concerns.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think you have very legitimate concerns.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But I do think it's possible,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
They may be yours more than his.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You're dealing with very real frustrations,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Yet most of your complaints,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Your son must be unhappy;,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Your grandchildren's upbringing would disappoint kamala;,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Kamala would disapprove of Julia.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I guess I'm beginning to wonder,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
If you have trouble voicing,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Grievances of your own.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
The fact of the matter is that you're the one,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Who feels stuck in your son's house,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Who's been cloistered away upstairs with the kids.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They knocked on your door this morning,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To make a collective request about your hygiene.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Julia polices the way you handle the objects in her bathroom.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You don't have the power to smoke where or when you want.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You have a right to be angry.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And it's becoming clear to me,Therapist,neutral,Approval
That on some level you are.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So I'm just thinking it might be helpful,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"To everybody, but mostly for you",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
If you could begin to express that anger,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"More directly, try to put it into...",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Try to put it into words.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I'm beginning to regret,Client,neutral,undefined
That I requested you to speak more.,Client,neutral,undefined
This is not quite what I'd meant,Client,neutral,undefined
By balanced conversation.,Client,neutral,undefined
I know. You'd rather meet a friend for tea.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Tea is terrible in New York.,Client,neutral,undefined
You disagree?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh no, I don't.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're Irish. You must enjoy tea.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, I do.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So maybe you can tell me what is wrong with Americans.,Client,neutral,undefined
In India we drink hot tea.,Client,neutral,undefined
Here it is often no warmer than dishwater.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's true.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
See?,Client,neutral,undefined
"There, I was expressing my frustration.",Client,neutral,undefined
How did I do?,Client,neutral,undefined
It's a good start.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"See, there was one occasion",Client,neutral,undefined
"When I spoke openly to Arun,",Client,neutral,undefined
When I presented my displeasure.,Client,neutral,undefined
And when was that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Many years ago, when he and Julia were first engaged.",Client,neutral,undefined
We had never met Julia.,Client,neutral,undefined
So they came to Calcutta to tell us the good news.,Client,neutral,undefined
You didn't see it that way?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"At first I did. Arun seemed so happy,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Like a small child handed a special dessert,",Client,neutral,undefined
Barely able to breathe.,Client,neutral,undefined
I must admit I was pleased,Client,neutral,undefined
"For arun to receive so much attention,",Client,neutral,undefined
Much more than we were used to seeing...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Like holding hands, sitting very close.",Client,neutral,undefined
"She... she even curled his hair behind his ear, eh?",Client,neutral,undefined
In our presence.,Client,neutral,undefined
I thought kamala was going to faint.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how did things go between kamala and Julia?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Very bad.,Client,neutral,undefined
Mm-hmm.,Client,neutral,undefined
Toward the end of dinner Julia expressed her disappointment,Client,neutral,undefined
That we would not allow her to stay at our home.,Client,neutral,undefined
So where was she staying?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
In a hotel.,Client,neutral,undefined
And where was arun?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"He stayed with us, in his old room.",Client,neutral,undefined
You must understand,Client,neutral,undefined
It's not acceptable,Client,neutral,undefined
For a couple to sleep,Client,neutral,undefined
In the House of the parents before they are married.,Client,neutral,undefined
So during dinner it was clear,Client,neutral,undefined
She wanted arun to discuss these matters with us.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So when arun could not bring himself to do it,",Client,neutral,undefined
She proceeded to do so herself.,Client,neutral,undefined
She said they had traveled such a far distance,Client,neutral,undefined
And they are very tired,Client,neutral,undefined
And they wished not to be separated.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Arun was so embarrassed,",Client,neutral,undefined
He could not even look at his mother and me.,Client,neutral,undefined
How did you and your wife respond to that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"After arun left to escort Julia back to her hotel,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Kamala was so angry,",Client,neutral,undefined
She could not speak for more than one hour.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then she pleaded with me to speak to arun.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So the next night, I sat in the kitchen with arun",Client,neutral,undefined
And asked him whether he...,Client,neutral,undefined
Whether he was sure about his decision to marry.,Client,neutral,undefined
What did he say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He lashed out at me.,Client,anger,undefined
He said we did not approve of Julia,Client,anger,undefined
Because... because she's not Bengali.,Client,anger,undefined
And he said I could not relate to his life,Client,anger,undefined
And I married a woman I did not love,Client,anger,undefined
And I... I chose duty over passion,Client,anger,undefined
And... and...,Client,anger,undefined
And I'm jealous.,Client,anger,undefined
So they cut their visit short by three days,Client,anger,undefined
And left to America the following morning.,Client,anger,undefined
So do you think there was any truth in what arun said?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That I do not know passion?,Client,neutral,undefined
He also said that you were jealous.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Perhaps I did not marry,Client,neutral,undefined
"For the same reasons as my son,",Client,neutral,undefined
But I came to love my wife.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you ever wish for something more in life?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you wish for something more?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"After that,",Client,depression,undefined
Things were different with arun.,Client,depression,undefined
"When Samuel was born we came to New York,",Client,depression,undefined
And again after Naya.,Client,depression,undefined
But it was never the same.,Client,depression,undefined
Did arun ever come back to Calcutta to visit?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Only once,",Client,depression,undefined
"When his mother was in serious decline,",Client,depression,undefined
Just two days before she passed.,Client,depression,undefined
That must have been another difficult visit.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What were you just thinking?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
On this same visit my son made his promise to kamala.,Client,neutral,undefined
That he would bring you back to New York.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yes, she told him that I was not capable of living on my own",Client,depression,undefined
And he must take care of me always.,Client,depression,undefined
These were the last words she spoke.,Client,depression,undefined
And so here you are.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Here I am.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you wish you had stayed in Calcutta?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"See, it is the way we do things, Paul...",Client,neutral,undefined
The children care for their parents.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think about going back?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's not possible.,Client,depression,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I have no money, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
"I have no money, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
"Although I should have, but I do not.",Client,depression,undefined
Can I ask you why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"See, much of my earnings went toward paying",Client,depression,undefined
For Arun's American education.,Client,depression,undefined
And what was left was spent,Client,depression,undefined
On kamala's medical bills.,Client,depression,undefined
So...,Client,depression,undefined
There is nothing to be done.,Client,depression,undefined
You seem resigned.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Have you and your son ever discussed,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The fight that you had on that first visit?,Client,neutral,undefined
We have never spoken of it...,Client,depression,undefined
Never.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"I'm afraid our time is up, sunil.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"Oh, I'm supposed to leave?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I have another patient,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
But we can pick up here the next week.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Okay okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If I'm going to walk,",Client,neutral,undefined
How do I get to prospect park?,Client,neutral,undefined
Prospect park? That's easy.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You go out, you turn left,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Pass the coffee shop on the corner,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Across the main drag. Once you...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I'll find it. I'll find it.,Client,neutral,undefined
No problem.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
No problem.,Client,neutral,undefined
You look tired.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry. I hate that.,Client,neutral,undefined
Don't ever tell me when I look like shit or tired...,Client,neutral,undefined
Or old.,Client,neutral,undefined
What's that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Here, open it.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's a prompter... an earpiece for aging actors,Client,neutral,undefined
Who can't remember their lines.,Client,neutral,undefined
Too bad they don't have something similar for younger actors,Client,neutral,undefined
Who refuse to learn theirs.,Client,neutral,undefined
The director wants me to wear it during performances,Client,neutral,undefined
In case I lose a line.,Client,neutral,undefined
So how did it go this week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
As to be expected.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Everything's fine,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Sailing along, and then...",Client,neutral,undefined
But I'm not wearing this fucking thing.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you tell that to the director?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I told the director that I am seeing the best psychoanalyst,Client,neutral,undefined
In New York and that I'm sure I'd be fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
So now both our reputations are on the line.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you'd like us to be in this together.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Aren't we?,Client,neutral,undefined
The stage manager keeps shanghaiing me backstage,Client,neutral,undefined
"To talk about her own memory problems,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Hormone treatments, hot flashes.",Client,neutral,undefined
She even gave me a book... the wisdom of menopause.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Oh God. I sound like a spoiled brat.,Client,neutral,undefined
You must think I'm ridiculous.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you say that?,Client,neutral,undefined
There's all this frivolous stuff I'm talking about...,Client,neutral,undefined
Lines and the stage manager. I can't...,Client,neutral,undefined
Frivolous compared to what?,Client,neutral,undefined
Last week when you were here,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You were worried about seeming frivolous,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Compared to your sister.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Tricia doesn't complain about anything.,Client,neutral,undefined
She faces it all so bravely.,Client,neutral,undefined
You must think I'm awful.,Client,neutral,undefined
I must think you're awful or ridiculous,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Or whatever.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Last week you were defending,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Your decision to take a job,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Instead of staying at home.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And you said, does that make me a coldhearted egomaniac?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Good memory.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe you should play this part.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you use language like that to describe yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is there some specific response,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That you're looking for in me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm sorry I even brought any of this up.,Client,neutral,undefined
I certainly didn't come here to talk about Diane the stage manager.,Client,neutral,undefined
So what are you here to talk about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Last week, do you remember when just before you left,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I asked you to keep an eye on what happens,Therapist,neutral,Open question
During rehearsal when you go up,Therapist,neutral,Open question
On your lines? How did that go?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No rhyme or reason that I could see.,Client,neutral,undefined
"One moment I'd be there,",Client,neutral,undefined
I'd be Maxine. And the next moment I'd be Frances,Client,neutral,undefined
And I'd be thinking of something else entirely.,Client,neutral,undefined
I can't tell you where I go when I jump like that.,Client,neutral,undefined
I want you to try.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I want you to really try,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
To remember.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Okay, two days ago I was in the middle of a scene",Client,depression,undefined
And I found myself thinking I needed to call Izzy.,Client,depression,undefined
"So I tried to force myself back into the scene,",Client,depression,undefined
"But I couldn't remember anything, didn't know was happening, total blank.",Client,depression,undefined
Why do you think you felt this need to talk to Izzy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. I wanted to talk to her.,Client,neutral,undefined
I called Russell later looking for her.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he told me that Izzy's been spending all of her time at Patricia's.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Taking care of her, I suppose.",Client,neutral,undefined
And did you call her there?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I didn't want to intrude. Izzy's always preferred Tricia,Client,depression,undefined
"And her father over me, which is ironic.",Client,depression,undefined
How so?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I met Russell through Tricia.,Client,neutral,undefined
I met Russell through Tricia.,Client,neutral,undefined
She introduced us.,Client,neutral,undefined
She was a graduate student at Columbia,Client,neutral,undefined
And he was this sort of brilliant,Client,neutral,undefined
"Youngish Professor,",Client,neutral,undefined
Kind of a star in the history department.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was 30, sick of dating actors,",Client,neutral,undefined
And she set us up.,Client,neutral,undefined
And what did she think you were going to like about him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, he wasn't the best-looking man I'd ever known,",Client,neutral,undefined
But he was the smartest and funny.,Client,neutral,undefined
I liked his take on things.,Client,neutral,undefined
It was a turn-on.,Client,neutral,undefined
So he excited a part of you that hadn't been excited before.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I guess that's right.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he had...,Client,joy,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Really good hands.,Client,joy,undefined
Physically?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sexually?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"When Russell and I first had sex,",Client,neutral,undefined
It was completely overwhelming for me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I hardly knew him and we'd only been out on a few dates,",Client,neutral,undefined
But I don't know. I fell so hard in love with him.,Client,neutral,undefined
And it just all went really quickly.,Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't care about getting married,Client,neutral,undefined
"But he did, so we got married.",Client,neutral,undefined
You mean that you got married to please him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No no, I was just surprised by how much he wanted to.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Later on, I did a lot of things to please Russell.",Client,neutral,undefined
Like what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Getting pregnant.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Of course, I wanted to be a mother.",Client,neutral,undefined
Just happened very fast. It had to.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was 35, he was 42-43.",Client,neutral,undefined
So the clock was ticking.,Client,neutral,undefined
So did you feel that you wanted more time to be alone with him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Just the two of you? A lot of people feel ambivalent,Therapist,neutral,Open question
When they bring a child into a marriage.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They're afraid that it's gonna change,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
The dynamic of the relationship.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
They're right.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Mm-hmm.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When I got pregnant with Izzy,",Client,neutral,undefined
I was really afraid that he wouldn't want me anymore.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd be fat and I'd get sick.,Client,neutral,undefined
And did he still...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Want you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, he still wanted me.",Client,neutral,undefined
He liked my new pregnant body.,Client,neutral,undefined
So did I.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then when Izzy was born,Client,neutral,undefined
"I thought, well, now it'll be ruined.",Client,neutral,undefined
The sex I mean.,Client,neutral,undefined
What exactly were you worried about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, that I would be destroyed by childbirth",Client,depression,undefined
And that he would be horrified by what he saw.,Client,depression,undefined
Were you in the room when your children were born?,Client,depression,undefined
"So you know. I mean, women tear themselves apart",Client,depression,undefined
To push a baby out.,Client,depression,undefined
"I just turned into this screaming, bleeding,",Client,depression,undefined
Sweating animal.,Client,depression,undefined
"I thought I'd never recover,",Client,depression,undefined
I would be permanently damaged.,Client,depression,undefined
Of course.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The female body is remarkable, don't you think?",Client,neutral,undefined
And did he lose interest?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, he still wanted me.",Client,neutral,undefined
He used to come in and take pictures of me when I was nursing.,Client,neutral,undefined
He thought I looked beautiful.,Client,neutral,undefined
And did you feel beautiful?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I felt fat, not beautiful.",Client,neutral,undefined
But then later,Client,neutral,undefined
I really got to love it.,Client,joy,undefined
That feeling of my breasts filling up,Client,joy,undefined
And that was what she needed.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, that little beautiful warm head",Client,joy,undefined
"In the crook of my arm,",Client,joy,undefined
What could be sweeter?,Client,joy,undefined
So you felt important,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
When you were nursing.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, I felt like I had a purpose.",Client,neutral,undefined
Then she grew up.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, they tend to do that.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
But now it seems that,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You feel Izzy doesn't need you anymore.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She hasn't needed me for a long time.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, she's a teenager. It's fairly ordinary.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, but she pushed away from me a long time ago.",Client,depression,undefined
She hasn't needed me since she was 6 or 7.,Client,depression,undefined
You said that you felt that she'd always,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Preferred your husband to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, daddy's little girl.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And now you feel like they're coming together,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
United against you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Team Wiskowitz.,Client,neutral,undefined
Look...,Client,depression,undefined
I lost Izzy a long time ago.,Client,depression,undefined
"But Russell, that...",Client,depression,undefined
That was a bit of a shock.,Client,depression,undefined
When did you separate?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Two years ago. He had an affair.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, you said, with one of his students.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Oh God, what a cliché, huh?",Client,depression,undefined
I was faithful.,Client,depression,undefined
I had a lot of jobs out of town.,Client,depression,undefined
"Many opportunities, but I resisted.",Client,depression,undefined
He had to go and piss all over everything.,Client,depression,undefined
Can I tell you something that I haven't told anyone?,Client,depression,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I haven't had sex since Russell and I broke up.,Client,depression,undefined
There you go again.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
What I think about you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That I must think this or I must think that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Are you hoping that maybe I'll agree with you?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Would you like to tell me about this period,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of abstinence?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, everyone knows that a virgin has the best complexion.",Client,neutral,undefined
So it's an aesthetic choice.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No. I just figure,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Really, what's the point?",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, at my age?",Client,neutral,undefined
Here's the kicker.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Guess who's getting laid, or is about to?",Client,neutral,undefined
She tell you that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She doesn't talk to me anymore.,Client,depression,undefined
I've been reading her emails.,Client,depression,undefined
I hacked into her account.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, no, that sounds too sophisticated.",Client,neutral,undefined
I guessed her password.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you really think that's the best way,Therapist,neutral,Open question
To get close to your daughter?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She won't talk to me.,Client,anger,undefined
How would you like it if your kids stopped talking to you?,Client,anger,undefined
I don't know what's going on in her life.,Client,anger,undefined
She says she's in love.,Client,anger,undefined
You don't think that's possible?,Client,anger,undefined
"She's 15. I mean, a crush maybe, but love?",Client,anger,undefined
"And this boy, this miller...",Client,anger,undefined
That's his first name... he's a junior.,Client,anger,undefined
"What's he doing, messing around with a freshman?",Client,anger,undefined
"He's writing her love letters, you know, quoting poetry.",Client,anger,undefined
"It's not bad poetry... e.E. Cummings,",Client,anger,undefined
"William Carlos Williams, Pablo Neruda.",Client,anger,undefined
Sounds kind of romantic.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Innocent, even.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
flower of fire... Swollen fruit raised?,Client,neutral,undefined
That's Neruda.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, not so innocent, huh?",Client,anger,undefined
Do you feel then that he's pressuring her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Just the opposite. He says he'll wait.,Client,anger,undefined
"They have time. He loves her, blah blah.",Client,anger,undefined
"That sounds mature, responsible.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"No, it sounds devious and Machiavellian.",Client,anger,undefined
He wants to get in her pants. You have a daughter.,Client,anger,undefined
Patricia remembers when your daughter was born.,Client,neutral,undefined
You had a big bouquet of pink roses out in the office.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She said you could hardly contain yourself, you were so happy.",Client,neutral,undefined
Yeah.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
We called her Rosie,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So we got a lot of roses.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You should've called her Ruby.,Client,neutral,undefined
We should have.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
She must be 18 now.,Client,neutral,undefined
Don't you worry about her getting pregnant?,Client,neutral,undefined
Or h.I.V. Or genital warts?,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you know that 70% of sexually active kids,Client,neutral,undefined
Carry this virus? It's an epidemic.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's my point.,Client,anger,undefined
Who is this boy? She won't talk to me.,Client,anger,undefined
She won't tell me anything about him. She just talks to Tricia.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, it makes a lot of sense, don't you think?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Did you talk to your mother about sex?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Fine. I see your point.,Client,neutral,undefined
Trish and Izzy...,Client,neutral,undefined
They even look alike.,Client,neutral,undefined
Those big brown eyes blinking at you.,Client,neutral,undefined
You remember? They're two peas in a pod.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And again, you're excluded.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
When Tricia had her chemo Izzy shaved her head in solidarity.,Client,neutral,undefined
Now she keeps on shaving it.,Client,neutral,undefined
She looks like a big-eyed bald alien.,Client,neutral,undefined
You find her alien?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Don't read too much into it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay. Well, can I read a little into it?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
In what ways is she alien to you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What is about her besides her bald head,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That makes her seem so unfamiliar?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"The truth is, the way she looks now,",Client,depression,undefined
It's exactly the way she looked when I was nursing her.,Client,depression,undefined
Patricia couldn't have kids of her own,Client,depression,undefined
And now she's sick.,Client,depression,undefined
And I'm jealous anyway.,Client,depression,undefined
Still.,Client,depression,undefined
"I begrudge her the one pleasure she has,",Client,depression,undefined
Which is time with my daughter,Client,depression,undefined
While she's suffering.,Client,depression,undefined
I had the worst thought the other DA,Client,depression,undefined
Tell me.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"No, Izzy's spending all of her time with Tricia.",Client,depression,undefined
"She hardly even takes my calls and when she does,",Client,depression,undefined
She just guilt trips me about not being there for Trish,Client,depression,undefined
Or being in the play.,Client,depression,undefined
Go on.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I thought...,Client,depression,undefined
That maybe when Tricia's gone...,Client,depression,undefined
Izzy will let me back into her life.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, that she'll be mine again.",Client,depression,undefined
Like when she was a little girl.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you feel that Patricia has usurped your role,Therapist,neutral,Open question
As Izzy's mother?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you feel that Patricia has usurped Izzy prefers her.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Tricia's better at it.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yet because your sister's sick,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You punish yourself for feeling resentful.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Have you spoken to Patricia about any of this?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Have you spoken to Patricia at all?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Yeah, once to say hi.",Client,depression,undefined
And did she tell you that she and I spoke?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
When?,Client,neutral,undefined
I called her last Wednesday.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
The day after I came in.,Client,neutral,undefined
May I ask why?,Client,neutral,undefined
I just wanted to see how she was doing.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I told her I heard she'd been ill,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But I didn't say how I'd heard.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
She told me about the cancer.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And I asked her if she had the support she needed,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And if she was seeing a therapist.,Client,neutral,undefined
She is.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
See? Everything's fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
No conflict of interest.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you tell her that I came in?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I didn't mention you, no.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"And neither did she, which I thought was odd.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Because last week you said,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That Patricia had recommended me to you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You said you'd asked her permission to see me,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And that she had given it to you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You implied it.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You led me to believe that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You certainly did nothing to correct my misconception.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Trap you?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That sounds very conniving.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"What, do you want to catch me in a lie?",Client,anger,undefined
Did I catch you in a lie?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was afraid you wouldn't treat me.,Client,depression,undefined
"For your therapy to be effective,",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's important that we be as honest,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
As we can with each other.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Do you understand?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
All right.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
"God, it sounds like we're in a relationship or something.",Client,neutral,undefined
Therapy is a relationship.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You're getting the short end of the stick on this one.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, all the crazy, none of the sex.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'll tell her.,Client,neutral,undefined
Before the next session.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Okay, I promise.",Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
So do you know that if you test positive,Client,neutral,undefined
"For the brca1 and your mother and your sister had breast cancer,",Client,neutral,undefined
You have a 90% chance that you'll get sick?,Client,neutral,undefined
This is the test Patricia's been wanting you to take.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it's one of the reasons why you've been avoiding seeing her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I made the appointment,",Client,neutral,undefined
So she can stop nagging me now.,Client,neutral,undefined
You know what they recommend,Client,neutral,undefined
If you test positive for the gene?,Client,neutral,undefined
Prophylactic mastectomy.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's removing both your breasts before you're sick.,Client,neutral,undefined
Doesn't matter what the result is.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not gonna have that operation.,Client,neutral,undefined
You wouldn't ever consider having it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
My sister had to have mastectomies. She had cancer.,Client,neutral,undefined
My sister had to have mastectomies. She had cancer.,Client,neutral,undefined
The doctor said that was her best chance.,Client,neutral,undefined
She never thought about it. She had them removed.,Client,neutral,undefined
She never even had the reconstruction.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She said it made her feel powerful,",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, to be herself, scars and all.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, it looks...",Client,neutral,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Izzy and I went to see her when she came home from the hospital.,Client,depression,undefined
She really wanted to show us her chest.,Client,depression,undefined
"I wanted to say no, but I couldn't.",Client,depression,undefined
She just lifted up her shirt.,Client,depression,undefined
There was horizontal slashes.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, I only looked for a second.",Client,depression,undefined
"Of course, Izzy scolded me later.",Client,depression,undefined
"She said, mom, it's just skin.",Client,depression,undefined
But I couldn't breathe.,Client,depression,undefined
So I'd better test negative.,Client,depression,undefined
"If my life had been different, right?",Client,depression,undefined
"You know, if Russell would have stayed or...",Client,depression,undefined
"Couples, I think, get closer when stuff like this happens.",Client,depression,undefined
But alone?,Client,depression,undefined
51,Client,depression,undefined
Who would ever want me?,Client,depression,undefined
How could they even see me?,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, would you?",Client,depression,undefined
I'm sorry.,Client,depression,undefined
I know I'm not supposed to ask you things like that.,Client,depression,undefined
I didn't... just...,Client,depression,undefined
You've...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You've had a great deal of loss,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
All at once.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Russell, Izzy, now Patricia",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And the threat of losing your breasts,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
A part of your body that's erotic and maternal.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And that comes at a time just as Izzy herself,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Is just starting to become a woman.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you think I could just sit here a little bit longer?,Client,depression,undefined
Thanks.,Client,depression,undefined
How long do I have about?,Client,neutral,undefined
All right.,Client,neutral,undefined
Come on.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You don't tell anybody that I come to see you, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
Of course not.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Good. Don't.,Client,neutral,undefined
Our secret.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Thanks.,Client,neutral,undefined
How was your...?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
Given any more thought to Karen's phone call?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Who?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Karen, your... the woman who...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I was just kidding, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
I didn't forget the name of my fucking birth mother.,Client,neutral,undefined
Jesus.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Hey, have you ever heard of RISD?",Client,neutral,undefined
The art school?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah, they have this, um,",Client,neutral,undefined
Summer program that I kind of want to go to.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you want to tell me about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Um, there are like,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Um, there are like,",Client,neutral,undefined
200 kids there...,Client,neutral,undefined
All different kinds of artists.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you live in dorms and take classes.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then once a week you have these critics.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I heard from this girl who went there last year,Client,neutral,undefined
"That on Thursday, before critic,",Client,neutral,undefined
"The whole school, like, stays up all night",Client,neutral,undefined
And everybody comes out into the hall,Client,neutral,undefined
D plays music and...,Client,neutral,undefined
It sounds awesome.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sounds... sounds great.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I applied online.,Client,neutral,undefined
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
When?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
A few days ago.,Client,neutral,undefined
I sent them some of the pictures I showed you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You liked the one of the statue of liberty, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh yeah, very much.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"You didn't think it was, like, too cliché?",Client,neutral,undefined
"No no no, I thought it was really interesting.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
interesting is what somebody says,Client,neutral,undefined
When they think something is a load of shit.,Client,neutral,undefined
I thought it was a very striking image...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Two boats passing in front of her...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"One old, one modern.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Her placement in the picture made me think,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Of her place in history.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Whatever.,Client,neutral,undefined
As long as you didn't hate it.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you completed the application?,Client,neutral,undefined
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
Even got Ms. U to write me a letter of recommendation.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you want to see the brochure?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What do you think?,Client,neutral,undefined
It looks incredible.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I showed that brochure to Marisa last night.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you want to know what she said?,Client,neutral,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm not going to pay for that shit.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that what she really said?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
So what did she actually say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
we can't afford it.,Client,neutral,undefined
She didn't even look at the book.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She, like... she wouldn't even look.",Client,neutral,undefined
Is there some kind of financial aid that you can apply for?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Have you asked?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"It's for rich kids, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
"It's, like, six grand for three weeks.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, maybe there are some options available through the school.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Have you talked to your guidance counselor?,Client,neutral,undefined
Ms. U?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I told her I had it covered.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Why?,Client,neutral,undefined
"You've met her, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
We've talked on the phone.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Oh, you should meet her. She would like you.",Client,neutral,undefined
"You're, like, totally her type.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I met her last boyfriend. He was a total douche,",Client,neutral,undefined
"But he was all, like, dark and depress like you.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Are you trying to find out if I'm depressed, Jesse?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, you're a shrink. If you're depressed, you can deal.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm just trying to get you a little pussy.,Client,neutral,undefined
Jesse.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Vagina. I meant vagina.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Look, this is the woman who kept you",Client,neutral,undefined
From getting expelled during the Adderall incident.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, she's a good egg... Ms. U.",Client,neutral,undefined
"She's, like, the only one that has my back...",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, and you.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm a little confused as to why you should talk about her,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So... so crudely.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Whatever, dude.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If you want to give up on yourself, be my guest.",Client,neutral,undefined
Can we go back to the RISD application?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You said that you had the finances under control.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tell me about the plan.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
200 for a blowjob.,Client,neutral,undefined
"For 250, I'll take it up the ass,",Client,neutral,undefined
But you provide it. I'm kidding.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm gonna sell my Adderall.,Client,neutral,undefined
But...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm still kidding.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm gonna call Karen.,Client,neutral,undefined
Your birth mother? Or is that a joke too?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, she's rich, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
She lives in Westchester. And she owes me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, she, like, really really owes me.",Client,neutral,undefined
And have you called her back yet?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you spoken about her phone call to your parents?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why would I? It isn't their business.,Client,neutral,undefined
It isn't?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
The woman called me. I am her son.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, but you're also their son, aren't you?",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Look, I don't envy you, Jesse...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
The amount of stress you must be under.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
But I want to help you,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Sort out what you're feeling.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Right now I think you're worried about,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How to tell Marisa and Roberto about Karen's call.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I also think you're worried about calling Karen back.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So why don't we tackle the first anxiety before moving to the next?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think I should call Karen back first.,Client,anger,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I need money for RISD.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how do you imagine that's gonna play out?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You'll call Karen, ask her for $6,000,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And she'll say what?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Just talk it through with me, Jesse.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Just imagine the possibilities.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I get your fucking point, okay?",Client,anger,undefined
And what is my point?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You don't think she's going to give me the money.,Client,anger,undefined
I didn't say that. I don't know what she'll do.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"No, that's right. You don't.",Client,anger,undefined
You don't know anything about her.,Client,anger,undefined
But you feel as if you do.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You know what? I'm gonna go.,Client,anger,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because this is a waste of my time.,Client,anger,undefined
"How could do you think we could better serve your time, Jesse?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You could act like a normal fucking shrink, for starters.",Client,anger,undefined
I don't know what that means.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Ask me normal shrink questions.,Client,anger,undefined
Such as?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I don't know.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't know.,Client,anger,undefined
Ask me about my freaking week or something.,Client,anger,undefined

What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We got prank-called.,Client,depression,undefined
we?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, somebody's been calling our homephone.",Client,depression,undefined
"And when Marisa picks up, they hang up.",Client,depression,undefined
At first I thought it was Karen calling the house,Client,depression,undefined
Because she couldn't leave another message on my cell phone.,Client,depression,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
The mailbox is full.,Client,depression,undefined
I let that happen sometimes.,Client,depression,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So people think I'm really popular.,Client,neutral,undefined
How did you feel about Karen calling you at home?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It wasn't Karen.,Client,depression,undefined
It was Nate.,Client,depression,undefined
"Oh come on, man. You remember Nate...",Client,depression,undefined
"Starting point guard on the Dalton basketball team,",Client,depression,undefined
Straight as an arrow except for when he's sucking my dick?,Client,depression,undefined
"God, like my life isn't fucked up enough as it is.",Client,depression,undefined
Now I have a stalker.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you feel like he's stalking you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He called my landline. How did he even get that number?,Client,depression,undefined
"The phone book, possibly?",Client,neutral,undefined
Who does that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I know when I was young, we used the phone book quite a lot actually.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well sure, you grew up in preindustrialized Ireland.",Client,neutral,undefined
It was either that or tipping cows over for fun.,Client,neutral,undefined
I haven't heard you mention Nate in a while.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
When was the last time you saw him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Uh, a couple of months ago.",Client,neutral,undefined
He was getting on my nerves.,Client,neutral,undefined
How?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
He was just like asking me all these questions.,Client,neutral,undefined
He wanted to see where I lived.,Client,neutral,undefined
And that annoyed you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Uh, yeah, it annoyed me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Uh, yeah, it annoyed me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I told him we were homeless right now,",Client,neutral,undefined
"But as soon as we found a place, we would have him over for tea.",Client,neutral,undefined
I seem to remember that you told Josh and Raif,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Something similar when you met them...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Something about being homeless,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Because your father was in the army,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And your mother was a drug addict.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, he's not in the army.",Client,neutral,undefined
He's in the marines.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she's not a drug addict.,Client,neutral,undefined
She just has a little drug habit which causes her,Client,neutral,undefined
To snort all the money he sends us up her nose.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then every once in a while we get evicted,Client,neutral,undefined
"And have to, like, live in this shelter",Client,neutral,undefined
Until she can track him down again in Iraq,Client,neutral,undefined
And he sends us more money.,Client,neutral,undefined
It works every time.,Client,neutral,undefined
It turns Nate on like a Hoover.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is this perhaps part of the reason,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why you're so annoyed by Nate's phone calls?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you worried that he'll find out you've been lying to him?,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't give a shit.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was tired of him anyway.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If he does find out the truth, are you afraid",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That he'll be no longer attracted to you?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
Or that you won't be attracted to him?,Client,neutral,undefined
You said at first that you thought,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
The call was coming from Karen.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah. So?,Client,neutral,undefined
How did that make you feel?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, it wasn't Karen.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I know, but if it had been Karen and Marisa had...",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
It wasn't.,Client,anger,undefined
Do you think any part of you might have been relieved,Therapist,neutral,Open question
If Karen just called Marisa directly?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Wow, you're, like",Client,anger,undefined
"Wow, you're, like,",Client,anger,undefined
Kind of obsessed with this.,Client,anger,undefined
Whose are these?,Client,neutral,undefined
My son's.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What's his name?,Client,neutral,undefined
"What, I can't know his name?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I told you,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't talk about my children in therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I saw him in the hallway.,Client,neutral,undefined
He seemed kind of sad.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Could you put those back, please?",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What would you do if I hurled these through the window right now?,Client,neutral,undefined
"And why would you do that, Jesse?",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Are you angry with me for protecting my son's privacy?,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
What would you do?,Client,anger,undefined
I don't know what I would do.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Well, do you want to know what Marisa would do",Client,anger,undefined
If I broke a window at home?,Client,anger,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Nothing.,Client,anger,undefined
"She would just, Li,",Client,anger,undefined
Pick up the glass and say nothing.,Client,anger,undefined
I could bring two guys home,Client,anger,undefined
"And fuck them in front of her on the living room floor,",Client,anger,undefined
And she would just step over us and offer them some tea.,Client,anger,undefined
Probably not.,Client,anger,undefined
Because I'm a degenerate.,Client,anger,undefined
Bet you're regretting you took me on pro Bono right about now.,Client,depression,undefined
I didn't take you on pro Bono.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Who's paying you?,Client,neutral,undefined
Your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Because therapy costs money, Jesse.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
But I thought Ms. U found you.,Client,neutral,undefined
She did.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I mean, after adderallgate she said",Client,depression,undefined
"If I didn't want to get expelled,",Client,depression,undefined
I had to see a therapist.,Client,depression,undefined
And I thought she called you and asked you to see me.,Client,depression,undefined
That's right.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
For free.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, your mother sends me a check every month.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Why did you think that therapy was free?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just did.,Client,neutral,undefined
They can't afford this.,Client,neutral,undefined
They must consider it important.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Known what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of course she'd rather pay a therapist than talk to me herself.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Do you think if I stopped coming here, she would pay for RISD?",Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know. You could ask her.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I once showed her these pictures,Client,depression,undefined
That I'd taken for a school project.,Client,depression,undefined
"I was developmentally challenged,",Client,depression,undefined
"So they let me do this, like,",Client,depression,undefined
Pictorial family tree thing,Client,depression,undefined
Instead of writing a report.,Client,depression,undefined
"I was, like, 12.",Client,depression,undefined
She hated them.,Client,depression,undefined
"She, like, made me promise",Client,depression,undefined
Never to show my father.,Client,depression,undefined
And what were the pictures of?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Normal things...,Client,depression,undefined
"The house where we had this reunion,",Client,depression,undefined
"Other members of my family,",Client,depression,undefined
The beach.,Client,depression,undefined
Sounds like there was something in those photographs,Client,depression,undefined
That maybe frightened her.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Uh, yeah. Me.",Client,depression,undefined
What do you mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Look, Jesse...",Client,neutral,undefined
"Listen, I know you want me to like love Marisa",Client,neutral,undefined
Or like develop an oedipal crush on her,Client,neutral,undefined
"Or whatever you people consider normal,",Client,neutral,undefined
"But it's just not going to happen that way, okay?",Client,neutral,undefined
I've read all about this stuff.,Client,neutral,undefined
What stuff?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maternal instincts.,Client,neutral,undefined
Biological imprints.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When real parents see their kid,",Client,neutral,undefined
"They get, like, this hormone surge... oxycontin.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oxytocin, yeah.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, that's it.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And it makes them, like, feel good.",Client,neutral,undefined
"They get, like, addicted to their baby.",Client,neutral,undefined
But...,Client,neutral,undefined
"When Marisa looks at me,",Client,depression,undefined
All she sees are two strangers fucking.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, it's fine.",Client,depression,undefined
I don't feel anything,Client,depression,undefined
When I look at her either.,Client,depression,undefined
"But, you know, what's hard though is, like,",Client,depression,undefined
"All the lying,",Therapist,sadness,Communication Skills
"Like pretending that she loves me,",Client,sadness,undefined
"Pretending that I love her,",Client,sadness,undefined
Pretending my whole life hasn't just been,Client,sadness,undefined
One giant...,Client,sadness,undefined
"Finish the thought, Jesse.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Mistake.,Client,sadness,undefined
And who made the mistake?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Was it Marisa?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Karen?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Was it you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"God,",Client,neutral,undefined
Look at you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You've got like a total hard-on right now, don't you?",Client,anger,undefined
"You've got yourself, like,",Client,anger,undefined
All aroused by some idea,Client,anger,undefined
And you can't wait to come all over me with it.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you think I have Tourette's?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I don't.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Should we maybe talk about why I think I have Tourette's?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why don't we go back to talking about Nate,Client,neutral,undefined
"And how he's, like, borderline obsessed with me?",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think I should get a restraining order?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I don't.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Well, what do you think I should do?",Client,neutral,undefined
I think you should talk to him.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I think you should tell him,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Why his phone calls upset you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Do you know why his phone calls upset you?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
He's stalking me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, he's not.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He's calling your house because he can't reach you on your cell phone,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And he just wants to talk to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know, Jesse,",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
But my guess would be that he's interested in knowing more about you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And I think,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That really scares you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
This story that you told Nate... the one about being homeless...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Have you ever asked yourself where that comes from?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I made it up.,Client,neutral,undefined
But why somebody who's homeless?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You tell it so often, it's become like",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
An alter ego.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You step in a phone booth... you become a different Jesse.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And every time that you enter,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"A new intimate relationship,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You start to play this part. And so you remain protected.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because the person having sex with Josh and Raif or Nate,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Isn't really you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The real Jesse can't be hurt,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because he isn't even there.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And now suddenly,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You're on the verge of finding out the truth,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
About where you really come from.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That must be unsettling.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you planning to call Karen back this week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because if you do...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Relax, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If I want to get to RISD,",Client,anger,undefined
I'll just sell my Adderall or something.,Client,anger,undefined
But you knew that the RISD summer program,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Was too expensive for your family to afford.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why did you apply?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I really wanted to go!,Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, I think that's true.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
And I also think it was a test,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That you knew Marisa would fail,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because she had to.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She doesn't have the money.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And when she did fail, you could get angry at her,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Which would perhaps make it easier,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To justify calling Karen back,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Without telling your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You don't have a fucking idea what you're talking about.,Client,anger,undefined
"Okay, tell me what I'm missing then.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'll call Marisa right now. You'll see.,Client,neutral,undefined
What will I see? What is she going to say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Uh, she'll probably be relieved.",Client,anger,undefined
Relieved?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yes, somebody's finally coming along to take me off her hands.",Client,anger,undefined
And what does that mean? What dose she do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,anger,undefined
Probably.,Client,neutral,undefined
Step over you and make tea?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Probably!,Client,anger,undefined
So in other words she's not gonna react at all.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She'll ignore the situation completely.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is that what you're afraid of?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are you this harsh on your own kid?,Client,anger,undefined
"I told you, I don't discuss...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Your children in therapy. Right.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, maybe you should.",Client,anger,undefined
Jesse.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Because he's headed for a world of pain.,Client,anger,undefined
Jesse.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It takes one to know one.,Client,neutral,undefined
Jesse.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I...,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you for seeing me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I know that I was a bit...,Client,neutral,undefined
Difficult the last time.,Client,neutral,undefined
A bit reluctant to engage in...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Anyway, my situation has changed.",Client,neutral,undefined
My son Max,Client,neutral,undefined
Is living with me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I arrived home from our session last week,Client,neutral,undefined
And he was sitting on the doorstep.,Client,neutral,undefined
He'd come up from Baltimore,Client,neutral,undefined
On the train by himself with his...,Client,neutral,undefined
With his suitcase.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he was saying,Client,neutral,undefined
That he wanted to live with me.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's 12.,Client,neutral,undefined
That is quite a change.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Of course my ex-wife is furious with me,Client,neutral,undefined
For allowing him to stay,Client,neutral,undefined
And for enrolling him in the wrong school,Client,neutral,undefined
And who knows how many other transgressions.,Client,neutral,undefined
How has it been for you,Client,neutral,undefined
To have Max living in your home?,Client,neutral,undefined
You spoke last time,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
About feeling alienated from your children.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, it's been two years since I lived with them.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And when I did, I'd have to say",Client,neutral,undefined
That Kate was more,Client,neutral,undefined
"Primary in their lives,",Client,neutral,undefined
"At least in the day-to-day stuff, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
So this is the first time you'll be playing that part.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Mm, a critical age, 12.",Client,neutral,undefined
They're just on the edge of...,Client,neutral,undefined
Everything really.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does that feel like a lot of pressure?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I do... I do feel pressure,",Client,neutral,undefined
But not...,Client,neutral,undefined
The other morning I was passing the cereal to Max,Client,neutral,undefined
And...,Client,neutral,undefined
My hand started to shake.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He didn't notice, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
"As much as I want to have Max with me,",Client,neutral,undefined
At some int very soon,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm gonna have to tell him about my illness.,Client,neutral,undefined
That I...,Client,neutral,undefined
That I have Parkinson's.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I just owe it to him to do it correctly,",Client,neutral,undefined
To discuss it with somebody,Client,neutral,undefined
And to do it... to do it right.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's why I'm here.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's why I came back.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm glad you did.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You had said you were seeing a neurologist.,Client,neutral,undefined
I also have to admit,Client,neutral,undefined
That you were right about something last week.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"You asked me if I have someone to talk to,",Client,neutral,undefined
Who I confide in.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I don't really.",Client,neutral,undefined
Wendy's becoming less and less that person.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And now that Max is living with me,",Client,neutral,undefined
I've had to ban her from staying over.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, what I mean is ask.",Client,neutral,undefined
I've had to ask her,Client,neutral,undefined
Not to stay over at my apartment.,Client,neutral,undefined
Would she prefer to stay with you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She'd have her name on the lease on Tuesday,Client,neutral,undefined
If I'd agree to it.,Client,neutral,undefined
And a fridge full of soy products.,Client,neutral,undefined
She keeps asking to meet Max.,Client,neutral,undefined
She... she says she loves kids.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I had to say no.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, I just think",Client,neutral,undefined
That he's so disturbed,Client,neutral,undefined
From living with Kate,Client,neutral,undefined
And her fiancé,Client,neutral,undefined
That I just don't think it's fair to put him in that position.,Client,neutral,undefined
Has Max talked to you about being disturbed?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, he's been begging me for weeks",Client,neutral,undefined
"To come live with me, saying how much he hates Steve.",Client,neutral,undefined
That's the fiancé... Steve?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yes yes. I'd actually expected,Client,neutral,undefined
My daughter Rosie,Client,neutral,undefined
"To have a harder time living with him and Kate,",Client,neutral,undefined
But she hasn't.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why did you expect Rosie to have a harder time?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
'cause we used to be,Client,neutral,undefined
Close.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, certainly closer than we are now, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
Are you equally worried to talk with her about your medical...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You were also right about something else last week.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, what's that?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
About Gina toll.,Client,neutral,undefined
You questioned her professional judgment last week.,Client,neutral,undefined
I defended her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Now that I've been reading her new book,",Client,neutral,undefined
I have to say that you were right.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're not enjoying the book?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She's revealed herself to be,Client,neutral,undefined
"Completely indiscreet, utterly selfish.",Client,neutral,undefined
"In my opinion, she should have her license revoked.",Client,neutral,undefined
So you were right.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is it easier for you to justify coming here,Client,neutral,undefined
If you think of Gina as selfish and me as right?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Excuse me?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Last week you had real doubts about me,",Client,neutral,undefined
And this week you're telling me I'm right about quite a lot.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Jesus Christ, some people",Client,anger,undefined
Really have a hard time taking a compliment.,Client,anger,undefined
"Look, you were right about her.",Client,anger,undefined
I don't know how else to say it.,Client,anger,undefined
It took you 30 minutes to discern something about Gina,Client,anger,undefined
That I apparently was blind to,Client,anger,undefined
For 25 years.,Client,anger,undefined
"While I was chatting away about my problems,",Client,anger,undefined
She was contriving the basis,Client,anger,undefined
Of one of the most miserable characters,Client,anger,undefined
That I have ever encountered in a novel.,Client,anger,undefined
Like the demon spawn of Bartleby and Shylock...,Client,anger,undefined
"This depressive, groveling outcast.",Client,anger,undefined
It's just despicable.,Client,anger,undefined
She's despicable.,Client,anger,undefined
And now she's avoiding my phone calls.,Client,anger,undefined
She won't return my messages.,Client,anger,undefined
You seem quite convinced...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"And if you read the book, it's perfectly obvious.",Client,anger,undefined
The guy is an associate Professor,Client,anger,undefined
"At an East coast college,",Client,anger,undefined
Repeatedly denied tenure by the chairwoman of the department.,Client,anger,undefined
Gina toll famously denied me the opportunity,Client,anger,undefined
To head up the psychoanalytic institute.,Client,anger,undefined
In the novel she describes this guy,Client,anger,undefined
As obsessed with his students...,Client,anger,undefined
"Their academic work, with their personal lives.",Client,anger,undefined
So much so that he ignores his real relationship...,Client,anger,undefined
The lovely wife and the two kids.,Client,anger,undefined
In one bit she says that this guy is,Client,anger,undefined
"Self-sabotaging, self-defeating,",Client,anger,undefined
That he's in a prison of his own making.,Client,anger,undefined
"She even calls the guy John,",Client,anger,undefined
As if she needed to be more overt about who she's attacking.,Client,anger,undefined
John was my father's name.,Client,anger,undefined
Yeah.,Client,anger,undefined
You're reading this as a personal attack.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You don't believe me?,Client,anger,undefined
I don't know what Gina's doing or not doing.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I am much more interested in how certain you seem to be,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
That she's based one of her main characters on you.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Do you think I'm making this up?,Client,anger,undefined
Can you tell me which part of what she wrote is most upsetting?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
All of it. The whole lot of it.,Client,anger,undefined
Everything.,Client,anger,undefined
There aren't specific passages in it that stand out for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You mentioned in particular the phrases,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"self-defeating, self sabotaging.  can you tell me about...?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I can't. Listen, let's just...",Client,anger,undefined
Let's just move on from that.,Client,anger,undefined
There's nothing to be done.,Client,anger,undefined
It's not a question of whether there's something to be done or not.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Look, I just don't want to talk about Gina toll anymore.",Client,disgust,undefined
I'll finish reading the book.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, I just don't want to talk about Gina toll anymore.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'll finish reading the book.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then if you like,Client,neutral,undefined
We could get back to it next week.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can you explain one...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Please, you know what? I...",Client,neutral,undefined
Is your hand bothering you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
Earlier you said you're concerned about,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How best to tell Max you have Parkinson's.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You mentioned last week you're seeing a neurologist.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you see a neurologist?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You seem reluctant to tell me what the doctor said.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Oh, I mean, you go to a top specialist,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Cornell's fancy new wing,",Client,neutral,undefined
State-of-the-art...,Client,neutral,undefined
You'd think he'd at least order,Client,neutral,undefined
A c.A.T. Scan or an m.R.I.,Client,neutral,undefined
He didn't do that?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"He asked me to touch my nose,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Walk down the hall, hop on one foot.",Client,neutral,undefined
And? How was that?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I touched my nose. I walked. I hopped.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then he told me that Parkinson's,Client,neutral,undefined
Is a hard disease to diagnose.,Client,neutral,undefined
That they misdiagnose 30% of the time.,Client,neutral,undefined
He said the scans can't really tell you anything,Client,neutral,undefined
Until the later stages.,Client,neutral,undefined
But for you at this point he thought...?,Client,neutral,undefined
"He thought, after our low-tech encounter,",Client,neutral,undefined
That I'm not exhibiting enough symptoms,Client,neutral,undefined
For a positive diagnosis.,Client,neutral,undefined
He said we'd have to wait and see.,Client,neutral,undefined
You don't seem terribly relieved.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I was so fucking relieved I actually called up Wendy,Client,neutral,undefined
And asked her out for sushi.,Client,neutral,undefined
She seemed shocked.,Client,neutral,undefined
She kept remarking about how up I seemed.,Client,neutral,undefined
So we sat down to lunch,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I thought to myself,",Client,neutral,undefined
"wow, here I am",Client,neutral,undefined
"Opposite this beautiful, fun woman.",Client,neutral,undefined
I found myself wondering why I ever doubted her.,Client,neutral,undefined
Sounds as if the doctor's visit had a significant effect.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, it did for about 20 minutes.",Client,neutral,undefined
And then the food arrived.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If you're worried about your hand shaking,",Client,neutral,undefined
Don't hold a piece of fish,Client,neutral,undefined
Between two 10 sticks of wood.,Client,neutral,undefined
I have an appointment in two weeks.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm gonna get a second opinion.,Client,neutral,undefined
You're seeing another neurologist?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I've had these symptoms for four months",Client,neutral,undefined
And they're not getting any better.,Client,neutral,undefined
It runs in my family. I think I owe myself,Client,neutral,undefined
A second opinion.,Client,neutral,undefined
Don't tell me you disagree.,Client,neutral,undefined
"If it will make you more comfortable to get a second opinion,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That's probably something you should do.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You're genuinely frightened about being sick.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
How has your sleep been this week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you wake up thinking about all this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I take a pill and...,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you still king up after several hours?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are you still having the same dream?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"What, are you hoping for another compliment?",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Another compliment to reject?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not sure I...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Are you hoping I'll tell you that your theory was right?,Client,neutral,undefined
That my dream contains images,Client,neutral,undefined
Of entrapment and paralysis?,Client,neutral,undefined
That's what you asked me at the end of last week.,Client,neutral,undefined
Does it?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Not that it was such a terribly difficult guess to make,",Client,neutral,undefined
But yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So go ahead,",Client,disgust,undefined
Make a note in your book...,Client,disgust,undefined
patient continues to lionize therapist,Client,disgust,undefined
To justify replacement of long-term analyst.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'll make a mental note.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Sounds good.,Client,joy,undefined
Will you tell me what you've been dreaming?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm...,Client,depression,undefined
I'm running,Client,depression,undefined
Along the outside of this,Client,depression,undefined
Tall wrought-iron fence.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'm outside. It's a field,",Client,depression,undefined
"Daytime, really bright.",Client,depression,undefined
The fence starts to curve,Client,depression,undefined
And I can sense,Client,depression,undefined
This opening up ahead...,Client,depression,undefined
Gates.,Client,depression,undefined
And I have this tremendous feeling of excitement.,Client,depression,undefined
My heart is thumping. I have this anticipation.,Client,depression,undefined
And then,Client,fear,undefined
My legs just...,Client,fear,undefined
They get... they get heavy,Client,fear,undefined
And I'm slowing down,Client,fear,undefined
As if I'm stuck in quicksand.,Client,fear,undefined
And I can't move.,Client,fear,undefined
I sense something behind me.,Client,fear,undefined
And I turn my head.,Client,fear,undefined
And...,Client,fear,undefined
It's my father.,Client,fear,undefined
He's walking towards me.,Client,fear,undefined
I'm paralyzed. He's coming closer.,Client,fear,undefined
And he's lurching,Client,fear,undefined
Towards me.,Client,fear,undefined
And...,Client,fear,undefined
And then I wake up with a start.,Client,fear,undefined
I just startle awake.,Client,fear,undefined
"I've been having that dream for months,",Client,neutral,undefined
Since just after the symptoms started.,Client,neutral,undefined
I...,Client,depression,undefined
Think I'm becoming my father.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm being overtaken by him.,Client,depression,undefined
I've tried my best to ignore it...,Client,depression,undefined
"The symptoms of the disease,",Client,depression,undefined
The coming paralysis.,Client,depression,undefined
Then I have the dream again,Client,depression,undefined
And it's... it's clear to me,Client,depression,undefined
What it's communicating.,Client,depression,undefined
I just can't...,Client,depression,undefined
I can't ignore it anymore.,Client,depression,undefined
"I woke up the other night, I went to check on Max.",Client,neutral,undefined
I watched him sleep.,Client,depression,undefined
I just can't bear the thought,Client,fear,undefined
Of what I might be passing on to him.,Client,fear,undefined
"Besides the physical issues,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are there personal traits,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You worry about passing on to your children?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"What, Parkinson's isn't enough?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I asked you before, but you didn't answer...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
How has your relationship been with Max since he arrived?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's been a full week.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Honestly,",Client,neutral,undefined
I've been worried about him.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've been worried about him.,Client,neutral,undefined
He just has his head in his sketchbook eight hours a day.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's got this leather-grade callus,Client,neutral,undefined
On his fingers from where he grips the pen.,Client,neutral,undefined
What are his drawings like?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Gloomy, abstract, vaguely violent.",Client,neutral,undefined
My teenage patient Jesse,Client,neutral,undefined
Happened to see him in the hallway,Client,neutral,undefined
Outside my apartment.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He said he seemed sad,",Client,neutral,undefined
Headed for a world of pain.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's hard to hear him describe Max like at?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, it was.",Client,neutral,undefined
Jesse's been trying to get me,Client,neutral,undefined
To ask his social worker out on a date.,Client,neutral,undefined
He says,Client,neutral,undefined
She's sad just like me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that how you see yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
As sad? Why do you ask?,Client,neutral,undefined
"What, do you think of me as chipper?",Client,neutral,undefined
Could that be what you're worried about passing on to Max?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I hope that he's happier than I am,",Client,neutral,undefined
And healthier.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But, you see, you have to understand,",Client,neutral,undefined
That's a major part of it... being sick...,Client,neutral,undefined
The burden I'll be placing on them.,Client,neutral,undefined
Not so easy to be happy when you got that dragging you down.,Client,neutral,undefined
dragging me down... that's very similar,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
To how you described yourself in the dream.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You feel this weight in your dream,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is connected to the Parkinson's.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I'm being pursued by my father,",Client,neutral,undefined
Overtaken by his illness.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's one interpretation.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You described yourself,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
As running along a wrought-iron fence,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
In a field.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Do you have any associations with that place,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Where you might be?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The feeling you describe...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm just... I'm just running.,Client,neutral,undefined
I-I-I...,Client,neutral,undefined
"As I said, I feel excited.",Client,neutral,undefined
"There's this feeling of,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't know, possibility.",Client,neutral,undefined
And my father stops me,Client,neutral,undefined
Just like he did in life.,Client,neutral,undefined
As he's doing now with my genetic inheritance.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm struck by the fact that you,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Become stuck, begin to slow",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Before you turn and see your father approaching.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"What do you mean, before?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, that's what you said.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm wondering if you have some agency,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
In stopping yourself from moving forward.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm slowing down. I'm dragged down.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then I turn and I see,Client,neutral,undefined
It's my father who's doing it.,Client,neutral,undefined
It angers you when I ask you about your role in this.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were also disturbed by what you take to be,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Gina's account of you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
As self-defeating or self sabotaging.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Look, any shrink will tell you",Client,anger,undefined
That a patient is the author of his own life.,Client,anger,undefined
Of course. Of course that's true.,Client,anger,undefined
You may now proceed,Client,anger,undefined
To second-year graduate studies,Client,anger,undefined
In human psychology.,Client,anger,undefined
But if you'll also recall,Client,anger,undefined
"Some of your coursework in medical school,",Client,anger,undefined
You'll remember that you can't deny the fact,Client,anger,undefined
That certain diseases are inherited.,Client,anger,undefined
I've inherited this illness from my father.,Client,anger,undefined
It's been forced on me. I didn't ask to have Parkinson's.,Client,anger,undefined
I didn't ask to be sick.,Client,anger,undefined
Do you think about what your life might become,Therapist,neutral,Open question
If you do have Parkinson's?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of course I do.,Client,neutral,undefined
Every day.,Client,neutral,undefined
What do you envision?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
What would your day-to-day life like?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I don't know. Probably something very similar,Client,depression,undefined
To what it held for my father.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know. Probably something very similar,Client,depression,undefined
To what it held for my father.,Client,depression,undefined
"I'd be less and less able to leave the house,",Client,depression,undefined
Less and less able to take care of myself.,Client,depression,undefined
Eventually I'd need care,Client,depression,undefined
In my own home.,Client,depression,undefined
"Then, in the final stages,",Client,depression,undefined
I'd be lifted up,Client,depression,undefined
And carried off to a nursing home,Client,depression,undefined
"Still in my fucking chair, given round-the-clock care",Client,depression,undefined
Like an infant in diapers and a bib.,Client,depression,undefined
Is there anything that feels comforting to you,Therapist,neutral,Open question
In that fantasy?,Client,neutral,undefined
Fantasy? Is that a joke?,Client,neutral,undefined
Does it seem significant to you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That you chose the image of an infant being cared for,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
As your notion of what it would be like to be sick?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, but it clearly does to you.",Client,anger,undefined
I am a grown man.,Client,anger,undefined
The idea of being swaddled and wiped and burped,Client,anger,undefined
Doesn't fall under the most attractive scenarios,Client,anger,undefined
For the majority of adult men.,Client,anger,undefined
We're not talking about the majority of adult men. We're talking about you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Precisely. Why the fuck would I want to have Parkinson's disease?,Client,anger,undefined
Why on earth would I find that comforting?,Client,anger,undefined
This is why I should have been more diligent,Client,anger,undefined
In finding a therapist with a bit of life experience.,Client,anger,undefined
You feel free to propose these absurd theories,Client,anger,undefined
Because you really don't have any idea,Client,anger,undefined
About what aging feels like...,Client,anger,undefined
Watching your body fall apart.,Client,anger,undefined
You have no idea,Client,anger,undefined
What that is.,Client,anger,undefined
And you have no idea that just around the next corner,Client,anger,undefined
"Might be complete disability,",Client,anger,undefined
Might be the beginning,Client,anger,undefined
Of a very short road to death.,Client,anger,undefined
"You're 57 years old, not 80.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You were told this week by a qualified neurologist,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That you probably don't have Parkinson's...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
He said that we would have to wait and see.,Client,anger,undefined
And yet you continue to be invested,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
In this possibility that you do.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm trying to understand why.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"You've been to see two doctors this week, including me.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You have plans to see a third.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Do you find it comforting,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"To be cared for, protected in this way?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Can you tell me what it is you feel,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
These doctors are protecting you from?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I'm sick. There are doctors out there,Client,anger,undefined

I'm sick. There are doctors out there,Client,anger,undefined
Who help you when you're sick.,Client,anger,undefined
I understand.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Who help you if it turns out when you're ill,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'll be here for you,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
As long as you want to talk with me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think,Client,neutral,undefined
We're out of time.,Client,neutral,undefined
Will you tell me something before we finish?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
In the beginning of your dream...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You described it quite vividly...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"That excitement,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"The feeling of openness, possibility.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
When was the last time you felt that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can you remember?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Truthfully,",Client,neutral,undefined
No idea.,Client,neutral,undefined
Will you tell me something?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"When I was talking about Gina's book earlier on,",Client,neutral,undefined
You seemed to know the reference I was making,Client,neutral,undefined
When I said that,Client,neutral,undefined
The character was like bartleby.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why is it important to you to know?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I like to be understood.,Client,neutral,undefined
I need to know that when...,Client,neutral,undefined
"When I'm talking to somebody,",Client,neutral,undefined
That they understand me.,Client,neutral,undefined
They understand what I'm saying.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you know who I was talking about?,Client,neutral,undefined
The scrivener.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I gave Wendy this book,Client,joy,undefined
The first week that we met.,Client,joy,undefined
It's called the memory of running.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She hasn't read it yet,",Client,neutral,undefined
But she still thinks it's about running,Client,joy,undefined
It's not?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Have a good week.,Client,joy,undefined
The shopkeeper gave me clear instruction,Client,neutral,undefined
That it should not steep more than three minutes,Client,neutral,undefined
Or the tea will turn bitter.,Client,neutral,undefined
It smells a bit like roasted peanuts.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Oh, it will be much more pleasing, believe me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, by the way, you...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You left this last week.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Paul, I suppose you are familiar",Client,neutral,undefined
With this reality television program...,Client,neutral,undefined
survivors?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh yeah, sure.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
But I haven't seen it.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What it is... two teams of American citizens,Client,neutral,undefined
Are stranded on an island.,Client,neutral,undefined
And they compete in the most unpleasant conditions.,Client,neutral,undefined
There's no food.,Client,neutral,undefined
And they compete in they have to pleasant costruggle for water.,Client,neutral,undefined
They have to battle for water.,Client,neutral,undefined
And the women walking and jumping around naked...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Almost naked, practically naked, without dignity.",Client,neutral,undefined
And during competition,Client,neutral,undefined
They fight each other in the mud,Client,neutral,undefined
And run like crazed animals.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And they do all this willingly, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
Did you find that disturbing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I could not help imagining what their husbands,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Wives and children must think, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined
They are willing to compromise,Client,neutral,undefined
Any principle they might possess,Client,neutral,undefined
For one million dollars.,Client,neutral,undefined
I suppose this is the cost of one's dignity in America...,Client,neutral,undefined
One million dollars.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd better go back to India,Client,neutral,undefined
Before I start building an obstacle course in my bedroom.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Are you afraid that watching this show might get to you,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
That it might tempt you to lose your own dignity?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I would not worry about that.,Client,neutral,undefined
So are you planning to watch the show again?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Thursday, 9:00 P.M.",Client,neutral,undefined
I was just thinking this is the first time,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I've... I've experienced,Client,neutral,undefined
Such excitement from you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Excitement? I was repelled.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, but you must have been kind of fascinated too.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And you even wrote down the time that it airs,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So that you can watch it again.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Time.,Client,neutral,undefined
Try.,Client,neutral,undefined
Careful careful.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Very good.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"You would be pleased with me, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I have been trying,Client,neutral,undefined
To make an attempt to be different.,Client,neutral,undefined
How so?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I have been thinking,Client,neutral,undefined
Quite a lot about your exercise...,Client,neutral,undefined
How I should begin,Client,neutral,undefined
To express my frustration.,Client,neutral,undefined
This is not easy.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's like learning to bowl a cricket ball,Client,neutral,undefined
With your opposite hand.,Client,neutral,undefined
It makes your head feel very heavy.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I'm really glad",Therapist,neutral,Approval
That you've been trying to do something different.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Two nights ago,Client,neutral,undefined
Julia was in her exercise room,Client,neutral,undefined
"On the second floor, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
"So I was trying to read,",Client,neutral,undefined
But I could not concentrate,Client,neutral,undefined
Because her music was so loud.,Client,neutral,undefined
I could... I could feel it,Client,neutral,undefined
"Vibrating through the floor, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined
So I thought I'll go down and ask her,Client,neutral,undefined
If she could please turn the music down a little bit.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But I could not bring myself to do this, Paul,",Client,depression,undefined
"Because she was running, bending, dancing, sweating so much",Client,depression,undefined
That I did not want to embarrass her.,Client,depression,undefined
"Julia was like a desperate animal,",Client,disgust,undefined
Wanting so badly to keep up.,Client,disgust,undefined
She was even punishing herself when she could not.,Client,disgust,undefined
"She was yelling, come on, Julia. Julia, come on.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Come on, Julia. Julia, come on.",Client,disgust,undefined
"So much sweating,",Client,disgust,undefined
"So out of breath, you know.",Client,disgust,undefined
Doom-doom doom-doom doom-doom doom-doom... constant.,Client,neutral,undefined
I have never seen her in that state before.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you watched her for... for quite a while then.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I suppose you find this amusing.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why would I find it amusing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The ways in which I choose to spend my time.,Client,neutral,undefined
I do think it's interesting,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That you described Julia in the same way that you described,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
The female television contestants...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Desperate, primal, like crazed animals.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And yet, even though you were repelled,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You still kept watching.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"And I can't help but notice how your energy,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
When you talk about this TV show...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I see the same kind of excitement,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
When you talk about... about Julia.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"My excitement, you said?",Client,neutral,undefined
I think that's accurate.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"The last time you were here,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You spoke about arun and Julia's first visit to Calcutta.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you remember how you described him...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That he was like a...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"An excited kid with a special dessert,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Barely able to breathe?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Quite a vivid image.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
And it just came back to me now,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
As you were telling that story.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Initially you said you were happy for arun,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That you shared his excitement about Julia. Would you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"My son, I think, seemed amazed, surprised",Client,disgust,undefined
That a woman like Julia agreed to be his wife.,Client,disgust,undefined
A woman like Julia... what do you mean by that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Let me explain it to you in this way...,Client,neutral,undefined
"When arun was away at school,",Client,neutral,undefined
His mother kamala...,Client,neutral,undefined
She had identified a Bengali girl,Client,neutral,undefined
That she thought would be a good match for him.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She came from a very well-respected Brahmin family,",Client,neutral,undefined
But she was somewhat fat and not terribly bright.,Client,neutral,undefined
And her name was Amolika.,Client,neutral,undefined
Her face was like a giant bullfrog.,Client,neutral,undefined
So now Julia is,Client,neutral,undefined
"A great contrast to Amolika, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined
You have seen her in person.,Client,neutral,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
She's...  she's not like a bullfrog.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
She's quite beautiful.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Do you think she's beautiful?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was clear that,Client,neutral,undefined
Arun felt fortunate to be with her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When they visited that fall,",Client,neutral,undefined
"He had to be near her all the time,",Client,disgust,undefined
As if he had to be touching her,Client,disgust,undefined
Or she would disappear.,Client,disgust,undefined
"When they were being affectionate with each other,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Was that hard for you to watch?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was more than just affection.,Client,depression,undefined
"One evening at supper, we all were sitting.",Client,depression,undefined
Julia kept adjusting her sari...,Client,depression,undefined
She borrowed it from kamala.,Client,depression,undefined
"Because it was large for her,",Client,depression,undefined
It was falling off her shoulder.,Client,depression,undefined
It could be a very difficult wear,Client,depression,undefined
For a new person.,Client,depression,undefined
"So arun tried to help her several times,",Client,depression,undefined
His hands grazing her bare skin.,Client,depression,undefined
Julia... more than once,Client,depression,undefined
She nudged him with her elbow,Client,depression,undefined
In a very playful manner.,Client,depression,undefined
Kamala saw it and she was so embarrassed,Client,depression,undefined
"That, you know, she excused herself from the table.",Client,depression,undefined
Were you embarrassed as well?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I managed to stay at the table.,Client,depression,undefined
So the following morning...,Client,depression,undefined
"The moment arun woke up,",Client,depression,undefined
He went to meet Julia at the hotel.,Client,depression,undefined
"Now Julia wanted to do some kind of shopping,",Client,depression,undefined
So we planned to meet her at the hotel at lunch.,Client,depression,undefined
"We waited nearly 10 minutes down in the lobby,",Client,depression,undefined
Then I went up to the room.,Client,depression,undefined
So I heard some unusual noises.,Client,depression,undefined
At first I thought,Client,depression,undefined
It's the sound of Julia weeping.,Client,depression,undefined
Then I realized...,Client,depression,undefined
My son's voice as well.,Client,depression,undefined
You heard them... you heard them talking?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Not talking.,Client,depression,undefined
They were engaged...,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, intimate.",Client,depression,undefined
"And the things they were saying to each other, Paul...",Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, so...",Client,depression,undefined
I simply stood there.,Client,depression,undefined
"And eventually kamala came up and she said,",Client,depression,undefined
do you realize how long you were gone?,Client,depression,undefined
And then she heard them as well.,Client,depression,undefined
How long had you been gone?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was terrible terrible terrible...,Client,disgust,undefined
The look on her face.,Client,disgust,undefined
She just turned and ran to the elevator.,Client,disgust,undefined
After that we didn't sleep for whole two days.,Client,disgust,undefined
And I've never seen kamala so so angry and so upset.,Client,disgust,undefined
Kamala truly felt that arun was making,Client,disgust,undefined
The biggest mistake of his life.,Client,disgust,undefined
So was this the event,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That precipitated your conversation with arun?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Were you as passionately against their engagement as kamala?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Paul, see, this is not acceptable behavior",Client,disgust,undefined
"For principled Bengali people, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Making love in a hotel, huh?",Client,disgust,undefined
Moments before you are to meet your parents for lunch?,Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, he is... he is our only child.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Yet when you first met Julia, you were excited for him.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was excited because he was excited.,Client,anger,undefined
But kamala was right...,Client,anger,undefined
"Julia is not a good match for arun,",Client,anger,undefined
And this is obvious to me now.,Client,anger,undefined
And Thursday night,Client,neutral,undefined
Was the anniversary of my marriage to kamala.,Client,neutral,undefined
So arun and me prepared a garland of flowers...,Client,neutral,undefined
A beautiful garland of flowers,Client,neutral,undefined
Which we arranged on Kamala's photo.,Client,neutral,undefined
We also prepared her favorite meal...,Client,neutral,undefined
Lamb curry.,Client,joy,undefined
So...,Client,neutral,undefined
Julia came. She came and took one bite,Client,neutral,undefined
And then left the rest untouched.,Client,disgust,undefined
I thought maybe she didn't like it.,Client,disgust,undefined
"It turned out she was saving her appetite,",Client,disgust,undefined
"Going to a big dinner for a young author, Ethan Barr.",Client,disgust,undefined
And this upset arun?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was his parents' anniversary.,Client,anger,undefined
"Yes, I understand that. But did it upset him?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
It clearly upset you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I think it's terribly terribly unfortunate for arun,Client,anger,undefined
That Julia places her personal desires ahead of her family.,Client,anger,undefined
Personal desires?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But it sounds like she had...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That she had a professional obligation.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"This Ethan Barr is quite young and successful,",Client,anger,undefined
And he looks more like a movie star than an author of a book.,Client,anger,undefined
the pale fox by Ethan Barr.,Client,anger,undefined
Julia calls him several times a day.,Client,disgust,undefined
They even talk on the weekend.,Client,disgust,undefined
She left Kamala's dinner,Client,disgust,undefined
Wearing extremely short dress...,Client,disgust,undefined
Bright green and extremely short...,Client,disgust,undefined
With her hair flatteringly styled.,Client,disgust,undefined
You think that she dressed like this,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
For this young writer?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"As she was exiting the house,",Client,neutral,undefined
I was sitting alone at the table,Client,neutral,undefined
Looking at Kamala's photo.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So she came and sat next to me,",Client,neutral,undefined
And she looked me in the eyes.,Client,neutral,undefined
She took my hand,Client,neutral,undefined
And kissed my cheek,Client,neutral,undefined
And said she was sorry about kamala.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she was wearing this perfume,Client,disgust,undefined
"Which was very strong,",Client,disgust,undefined
Just like black pepper and Jasmine.,Client,disgust,undefined
Arun spent the evening with the children.,Client,disgust,undefined
"He gave them their baths,",Client,disgust,undefined
Put them to bed.,Client,disgust,undefined
And the whole time his wife,Client,anger,undefined
"Is out with another man,",Client,anger,undefined
Wearing this perfume.,Client,anger,undefined
Must have been quite a surprise,Therapist,neutral,Approval
To have been dealt with by Julia,Therapist,neutral,Approval
In such an intimate way.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I was still stunned.,Client,anger,undefined
How could she leave Kamala's dinner so easily?,Client,anger,undefined
"And after that, I could not sleep.",Client,anger,undefined
"Lying in bed, I wondered...",Client,anger,undefined
"Even one year from now... one year,",Client,anger,undefined
"On the next anniversary of my marriage to kamala,",Client,anger,undefined
If Julia would still be around.,Client,anger,undefined
Where else would she be?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I fear things will not turn out good...,Client,depression,undefined
I fear things will not turn out good...,Client,depression,undefined
Good for arun and the children.,Client,depression,undefined
And what exactly is it that you're afraid is going to happen?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation

Do you suspect,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
That Julia is having an affair with this writer?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Do you?,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, there's no way that I can answer that.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Paul, Paul, if what you suggest is true,",Client,anger,undefined
Then Julia would bring great shame,Client,anger,undefined
Upon the family and...,Client,anger,undefined
And what?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
She would deserve a harsh punishment.,Client,anger,undefined
A harsh punishment?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What... what does that mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, I understand that in certain cultures infidelity...",Client,disgust,undefined
"No no, the system... the system in America",Client,disgust,undefined
Has turned the human being into consuming monsters.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, they just want to pursue",Client,disgust,undefined
Their immediate...,Client,disgust,undefined
Immediate desires at all cost.,Client,disgust,undefined
They will... they will feast on whatever...,Client,anger,undefined
"Whatever will fill their craving,",Client,anger,undefined
Believing that there are no consequences.,Client,anger,undefined
"Don't get me wrong, Paul...",Client,anger,undefined
I'm aware from experience,Client,anger,undefined
That to be disciplined is not easy.,Client,anger,undefined
It can be a struggle sometimes that...,Client,anger,undefined
To put one's family and honor,Client,anger,undefined
"Over personal gratification,",Client,anger,undefined
But it must be done.,Client,anger,undefined
There is nothing more important than this.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, you clearly have",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Some pretty intense feelings on this topic.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Does my intensity make you nervous?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No no, it's just I...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I just wonder where it comes from.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You said you know from experience,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How being disciplined isn't easy.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, can you tell me what you mean by that?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
What experience were you referring to?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"When I was an undergraduate student, I...",Client,neutral,undefined
"When I was an undergraduate student, I...",Client,neutral,undefined
I became close to a female classmate.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, and this was",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Before you met kamala?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Three months before, yes.",Client,neutral,undefined
So we met in the library.,Client,neutral,undefined
We were seated beside each other at a study table.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I could not concentrate,Client,neutral,undefined
Because her face and her hair...,Client,neutral,undefined
You must be aware of this painting by el Greco...,Client,neutral,undefined
the lady with a flower in her hair.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's a beautiful painting.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's... the woman's face,Client,neutral,undefined
Is filled... filled with longing.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sorry, what was your classmate's name?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Malini.,Client,neutral,undefined
Malini.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I convinced her to join me for lunch.,Client,neutral,undefined
And shortly after that we...,Client,neutral,undefined
We found ourselves spending nearly every moment together.,Client,neutral,undefined
You were a couple.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
A couple?,Client,neutral,undefined
You were together.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, together.",Client,neutral,undefined
And what happened to malini?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Sunil, what happened to malini?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
We stopped... we stopped seeing each other,Client,depression,undefined
Before graduation.,Client,depression,undefined
Things became very intense quite quickly.,Client,depression,undefined
We broke off the relationship and within a year,Client,depression,undefined
Kamala and I were married.,Client,depression,undefined
And this is... this is what had to be done.,Client,depression,undefined
"See, malini and I were not suited for each other, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
"She was not from a Brahmin family,",Client,depression,undefined
And it was not meant to be.,Client,depression,undefined
So you chose to be with somebody,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
From the same caste.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Honoring the dignity of my family,Client,neutral,undefined
Was important to me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you ever told anybody about malini?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No no no.,Client,neutral,undefined
I have not told a single person,Client,neutral,undefined
About malini in 30 years.,Client,neutral,undefined
Not even kamala?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No no no, you are the first person I'm telling, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
I... I had considered,Client,neutral,undefined
"Telling arun when he came to Calcutta, but...",Client,neutral,undefined
But you chose not to.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"No. Paul,",Client,neutral,undefined
You must never speak to anyone of this.,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course not.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You must promise me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sunil, I give you my solemn word",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That whatever you say in here stays between us.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Are there any circumstances,Client,neutral,undefined
In which you might disclose this information?,Client,neutral,undefined
Only in the most extreme circumstances.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What do you mean? What does this mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
It means that the only time I would betray the confidence of a patient,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Is if I felt somebody might be in danger,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Including the patient.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I promise you that everything you share in here is safe.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Do you ever wish you told your son about malini?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It would not have made any difference.,Client,anger,undefined
It would not have made any difference.,Client,anger,undefined
"He would have simply told me, you made the wrong choice.",Client,anger,undefined
You gave up on your passion.,Client,anger,undefined
And he would have married Julia anyway.,Client,anger,undefined
Do you think arun was right...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe you did make the wrong choice?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No no.,Client,anger,undefined
"No, I do not regret the choice I made.",Client,anger,undefined
I have... I have no patience for those,Client,anger,undefined
Who do not live a principled life.,Client,anger,undefined
You doubt me?,Client,anger,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You seem a little suspicious about my answer.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm not suspicious.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I just think that it's possible,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To be...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To feel several things at the same time...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Conflicted emotions.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm sure that kamala was,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"A wonderful, supportive wife to you",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you honor her memory,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
With dignity.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But it's also possible,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That you may be experiencing regret,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Over your decision,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To end things with malini.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They're not mutually exclusive emotions.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I got the sense that you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you were disturbed,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
When... when... when... when you heard,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Your son and Julia,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Making love in their hotel room.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But you stayed and you listened.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I listened because,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was like listening to a disaster.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I understand that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And I would understand you feeling critical,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Of your son's marriage,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
But at the same time,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Intrigued,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Fascinated,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Maybe even,Therapist,neutral,Approval
A little,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Jealous.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Why would I be jealous of a marriage,Client,anger,undefined
In which a vain and immodest wife,Client,anger,undefined
Is having a love affair with another man?,Client,anger,undefined
You seem convinced that Julia is having an affair.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
To me it's obvious.,Client,anger,undefined
She's living her life for some other person.,Client,anger,undefined
And do you think it's obvious to your son?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That I'm not sure. I'm not certain.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think he's jealous of this other guy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He has said nothing of being jealous.,Client,neutral,undefined
"When you talked about Julia earlier on,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You talked about her in detail...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"The length of her skirt,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Which you said it was short,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"That she had her hair done in a particular way,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And her perfume.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She took your hand and kissed you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's just a sense that I have,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Might feel betrayed by Julia...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Not just on your son's behalf,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But personally.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What an interesting tea we have had.,Client,neutral,undefined
Paul...,Client,neutral,undefined
Please check if the amount is right.,Client,neutral,undefined
Will you please?,Client,neutral,undefined
Is it correct?,Client,neutral,undefined
I just want to say that I'm sorry about,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
How the other evening turned out for you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm sure the first anniversary without your wife,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Must have been... must have been really tough for you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you. Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was beginning to think I had the wrong day.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Come in, please.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Sorry about that. I, uh...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I was just finishing off something.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Went to see Patricia yesterday,Client,neutral,undefined
"To talk to her about, you know, this... about you.",Client,neutral,undefined
Ask her permission to see you.,Client,joy,undefined
And what did she say?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Fine. She said it's fine.,Client,joy,undefined
You gonna call her?,Client,neutral,undefined
I really don't think that's...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Oh, you believe me.",Client,joy,undefined
Of course.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"So you're not gonna double-check,",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, when we're done just to make sure?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I don't really need to talk to her.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I don't have any intention of talking to her.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"She is sick, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined
She might appreciate you just checking in.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay. So you've given me a choice.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I could check in with your sister and make you jealous,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Or I could ignore her and make you angry.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I'm already jealous and angry.",Client,anger,undefined
Here.,Client,neutral,undefined
Found this at Trish's.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's Izzy's.,Client,neutral,undefined
Her favorite.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you borrowed it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
My daughter still won't talk to me.,Client,anger,undefined
And she has dinner with my sister every night.,Client,anger,undefined
They make soup.,Client,anger,undefined
Every week it's a different soup.,Client,anger,undefined
Last night was cream of broccoli.,Client,anger,undefined
God.,Client,depression,undefined
When I think of me making soup for Izzy,Client,depression,undefined
"When she was home sick with a cold or something,",Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, d open a can.",Client,depression,undefined
And I never remembered to add the extra water in.,Client,depression,undefined
It still smells like Izzy.,Client,joy,undefined
I took it as an excuse to see my daughter.,Client,depression,undefined
I thought maybe I could return it to her.,Client,depression,undefined
"God, I don't even know what I'm doing here.",Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, I should be somewhere working on my lines.",Client,disgust,undefined
Tonight is the first night of previews.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm thinking of inviting Patricia to opening night.,Client,depression,undefined
"Although... If she's up to it, I don't know...",Client,depression,undefined
She probably won't come.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you say that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
'cause she doesn't like parties or premieres.,Client,disgust,undefined
She likes p.B.S. And soup.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, you could ask her.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
And she could simply say no if she had to.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
It's not her thing.,Client,disgust,undefined
"She's seen all my movies. I mean, the major ones.",Client,disgust,undefined
She just doesn't make a fuss.,Client,disgust,undefined
Does she withhold her praise?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She withholds my daughter, all right?",Client,anger,undefined
"She withholds my daughter, all right?",Client,anger,undefined
I...,Client,anger,undefined
I was at Trish's.,Client,anger,undefined
She got cold and I went to get her a robe,Client,anger,undefined
And this is hanging on a hook.,Client,anger,undefined
She's hiding it from me.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, Izzy forgot it,",Client,anger,undefined
But Trish knew I'd be upset if I saw it.,Client,anger,undefined
So I smuggled it out.,Client,depression,undefined
I didn't want a confrontation. I just left there.,Client,depression,undefined
A confrontation about Izzy?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"About Izzy and... you know, she's one-track with me.",Client,disgust,undefined
She just can't stop talking about the brca1.,Client,disgust,undefined
And did you tell her that you'd made the appointment for the test?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I didn't want to open those floodgates.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I didn't want to open those floodgates.",Client,neutral,undefined
She's always preaching surgery statistics.,Client,neutral,undefined
She torments me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you take the test?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are you worried about me?,Client,neutral,undefined
On Friday as scheduled.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm still waiting for the results.,Client,neutral,undefined
The way you describe Patricia...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"That she's preachy,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She torments you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think you seem to take her anxiety as a form of aggression.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think it could also be,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
A sign of love.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, she's punishing me.",Client,neutral,undefined
Punishing you? Punishing you for what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"We were opposites, you know, growing up.",Client,neutral,undefined
"We were opposites, you know, growing up.",Client,neutral,undefined
Our mother used to call us beauty and the brain.,Client,joy,undefined
She was the star student,Client,neutral,undefined
And I was the star.,Client,joy,undefined
Did she tell you something differently when she was in therapy?,Client,neutral,undefined
You seem to care a lot about what people think about you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Me, Izzy, Tricia.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What do you think Patricia is punishing you for?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
When Tricia was at Johns Hopkins,Client,neutral,undefined
She was on a scholarship.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was in New York, you know,",Client,joy,undefined
Just finding a little bit of success.,Client,joy,undefined
She called all excited. She had news.,Client,joy,undefined
She had gotten cast in a play.,Client,joy,undefined
Clifford Odets' the country girl.,Client,joy,undefined
Mm-hmm.,Client,joy,undefined
She had auditioned on a whim,Client,joy,undefined
And gotten the lead.,Client,joy,undefined
The title role.,Client,joy,undefined
You sound surprised.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was totally surprised.,Client,joy,undefined
I was totally surprised.,Client,joy,undefined
I never knew she was even interested in such a thing...,Client,joy,undefined
Acting or the theater.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, it was sweet. She was sweet.",Client,joy,undefined
"Her enthusiasm, she thought it was so easy.",Client,joy,undefined
Do you remember who played the role in the movie?,Client,joy,undefined
Grace Kelly.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Grace Kelly, exactly.",Client,joy,undefined
"So Trish was this cast,",Client,joy,undefined
To say the least.,Client,joy,undefined
"But it was college,",Client,joy,undefined
And she really wanted me to come and see it.,Client,joy,undefined
So how was that for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, it was terribly earnest, but she was fine.",Client,joy,undefined
"Actually, she was one of the better performances.",Client,joy,undefined
We went out to dinner afterwards,Client,joy,undefined
"And she was so excited, you know?",Client,joy,undefined
So grateful that I had come.,Client,joy,undefined
She wanted to tell me her news.,Client,neutral,undefined
She wanted to tell me that she had always thought,Client,neutral,undefined
About being an actress like me.,Client,neutral,undefined
"But she had never had the courage to try,",Client,neutral,undefined
"And now she was getting all this wonderful attention, you know,",Client,joy,undefined
"From the school newspaper, her classmates, whatever.",Client,joy,undefined
And she was thinking that she would really take some acting courses.,Client,joy,undefined
"Maybe even transferring colleges,",Client,joy,undefined
Coming to N.Y.U. To be closer to me.,Client,joy,undefined
And she wanted to know what I thought of this idea.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, did I think she had the talent?",Client,neutral,undefined
Should she change course?,Client,neutral,undefined
So she was asking your advice as an older sister?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I gave it. Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
I told her no.,Client,depression,undefined
you don't have it.,Client,depression,undefined
Just become a lawyer like you planned.,Client,depression,undefined
Don't be an actress. Don't waste your time.,Client,depression,undefined
I mean...,Client,depression,undefined
I thought I owed her an honest response.,Client,depression,undefined
You know? You should not be an actor,Client,disgust,undefined
Unless you cannot bear to do anything else.,Client,disgust,undefined
It's just too fucking hard.,Client,disgust,undefined
And she had no idea how hard it was.,Client,disgust,undefined
And what was her reaction to that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She was pretty quiet.,Client,depression,undefined
She looked crushed.,Client,depression,undefined
"So as a result of that,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She never pursued acting.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She never did another play again.,Client,depression,undefined
Did you feel that you were responsible for...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I could have encouraged her a little bit more, don't you think?",Client,depression,undefined
She did ask you for your opinion.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
An honest opinion and you gave it.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Sounds like you and Patricia,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Had very distinct identities in the family.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the beauty and the brain. ,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Did your mother, do you feel, cast you in...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Listen, when I first started to come here",Client,disgust,undefined
I made myself one promise...,Client,disgust,undefined
"Listen, when I first started to come here",Client,disgust,undefined
I made myself one promise...,Client,disgust,undefined
"That no matter what other troubles we unveiled,",Client,disgust,undefined
"I would not blame my mother, so...",Client,disgust,undefined
But it's not about blame.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Fine, then you can stop pointing your finger at my mother.",Client,disgust,undefined
It seems to me that you might be a little...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Is that kind of a sensitive subject for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe because of the relationship,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You have with Izzy?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Isabel.,Client,neutral,undefined
Her full name is Isabel.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, she's named after my mother.",Client,neutral,undefined
I always thought it was a beautiful name. Glamorous.,Client,neutral,undefined
Not like my name... Frances.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I asked my mother, why did you name me Frances?",Client,neutral,undefined
"She said, oh, don't you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
I named you after Frances farmer.,Client,neutral,undefined
The actress.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, Frances. Well, what happens to her?",Client,depression,undefined
Sent to a nursing facility,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
She has a lobotomy.,Client,depression,undefined
And who put her in the asylum?,Client,depression,undefined
Right.,Client,depression,undefined
I called my mother from the lobby on a pay phone after I saw the film.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I said, mother, how could you name me after her?",Client,disgust,undefined
She had such a horrible life.,Client,disgust,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
but she was so beautiful.,Client,neutral,undefined
So being beautiful,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Was important to your mother, yeah?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, she was beautiful.",Client,neutral,undefined
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"People used to say that I looked like her,",Client,neutral,undefined
But I didn't think so.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She had, I don't know,",Client,neutral,undefined
"A delicate beauty, you know?",Client,joy,undefined
A natural grace.,Client,joy,undefined
"This is Isabel, 1970.",Client,joy,undefined
She carried that picture around till the day she died.,Client,joy,undefined
She liked to show people how she looked in all her glory.,Client,joy,undefined
Um-hmm.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
She's a very striking woman.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Trish thinks it's perverse that I carry,Client,neutral,undefined
This particular shot around with me.,Client,neutral,undefined
She says it looks so posed.,Client,neutral,undefined
She thought just because mother is obsessed with her looks,Client,neutral,undefined
Doesn't mean you have to be too.,Client,neutral,undefined
And was she obsessed with her looks?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not at all.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, I understand it, you know,",Client,neutral,undefined
Wanting to hold on a little bit.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was so critical of my looks when I was young.,Client,neutral,undefined
Every little flaw.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Now I look at images from that time and I think,",Client,neutral,undefined
"God, who is that gorgeous girl?",Client,joy,undefined
You want to own it.,Client,neutral,undefined
You want to feel that way inside.,Client,neutral,undefined
I like to remember my mother just like this.,Client,neutral,undefined
Not the way she looked at the end in the hospital.,Client,depression,undefined
Her skin got so translucent it looked almost blue.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, she was so little and frail",Client,depression,undefined
She looked like a tiny bird.,Client,depression,undefined
"Even at the end, she still wanted",Client,depression,undefined
To have her hair done every week.,Client,depression,undefined
"So she her... she had her pride,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Her vanity.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Vanity?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, yeah, maybe that's not the right word.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
She still wanted to look her best.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That's what I meant.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't know what you're talking about.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, you told me that your mother",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Always wore her signature red lipstick.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"That even in the hospital as she was dying,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She'd sit up and she would ask you,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
To come and do her face.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I never told you that.,Client,neutral,undefined
You never told me that?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Her lipstick, we used to call it the cherry.",Client,neutral,undefined
It was a classic... Maybelline cherry red.,Client,neutral,undefined
I barely mentioned my mother here.,Client,neutral,undefined
I certainly never said anything that specific.,Client,neutral,undefined
Tricia told you that.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe. Maybe you're right.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Of course I'm right.,Client,anger,undefined
She told you that all those years ago.,Client,anger,undefined
You heard it and you have never forgotten it.,Client,anger,undefined
"Honestly, I don't know why",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
That particular detail came into my head.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I apologize if it upsets you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't want to be confused with my sister.,Client,anger,undefined
"Are you thinking about her, what she told you, while I'm talking?",Client,anger,undefined
"No, I... ",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
because she has her own version of things.,Client,anger,undefined
"You know, vain? That's what she chooses to call our dying mother?",Client,anger,undefined
I don't know that that's what she actually said.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I was shooting a movie. I was going back and forth to the set.,Client,anger,undefined
"I was killing myself. And my mother's lipstick,",Client,anger,undefined
That's what she remembers?,Client,anger,undefined
"Honestly, I don't think that that's all she remembers.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, well, what else did she say? What?",Client,anger,undefined
"Yeah, well, what else did she say? What?",Client,anger,undefined
Did she call me weak?,Client,anger,undefined
Did she say I couldn't handle it?,Client,anger,undefined
Because I wanted to help.,Client,anger,undefined
But Tricia wouldn't let me. She did everything.,Client,anger,undefined
She practically moved into the hospital.,Client,anger,undefined
"At night, you know, I would want to read to my mother",Client,anger,undefined
Because she loved mysteries.,Client,anger,undefined
"But no, Tricia said, let her rest,",Client,anger,undefined
And sent me back to the hotel,Client,anger,undefined
While she stayed.,Client,anger,undefined
Stayed at the...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
stayed in the hospital.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, Tricia thought I was useless.",Client,anger,undefined
One morning I had to leave very early.,Client,anger,undefined
I had to get back to the set and I wanted to kiss my mother goodbye.,Client,anger,undefined
And I came to the hospital early,Client,anger,undefined
And I went to the room,Client,anger,undefined
And I saw Tricia.,Client,anger,undefined
She had climbed up in bed with mama,Client,depression,undefined
And she had her arm around her.,Client,depression,undefined
They were lying in the bed.,Client,depression,undefined
Is that what you called her when you were a little girl?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Mama?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, my daddy died when I was five.",Client,depression,undefined
Trish was one.,Client,depression,undefined
Our mother used to cry all night.,Client,depression,undefined
And she would come into the bedroom and...,Client,depression,undefined
She would take Trish out of the crib,Client,depression,undefined
And take her back to bed with her to sleep.,Client,depression,undefined
"I was wide awake, but she would choose Tricia every time.",Client,depression,undefined
It must have been very painful.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Well, Tricia didn't know what was going on.",Client,depression,undefined
"Can you see how your sister became the nurturer,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
The caretaker almost by accident,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Because she was cast in that role by your mother?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Later on when you were older,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She asked your advice about becoming an actress.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Oh, back to that. No, the truth is",Client,depression,undefined
That Tricia was wonderful in that play.,Client,depression,undefined
"Oh, back to that. No, the truth is",Client,depression,undefined
That Tricia was wonderful in that play.,Client,depression,undefined
She was really good.,Client,depression,undefined
But I never had the generosity,Client,depression,undefined
To let her know so.,Client,depression,undefined
U can still tell her. It's not too late.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You can still make amends.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't want to talk anymore.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've talked enough today.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"But you know what could be helpful, actually?",Client,neutral,undefined
"If you could just read this with me,",Client,neutral,undefined
That would be great.,Client,neutral,undefined
Isn't this what you used to do with Russell?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Don't worry. I'm not confusing you with Russell.,Client,neutral,undefined
Don't worry. I'm not confusing you with Russell.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Russell was an asshole. You actually,",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, make me feel calm.",Client,neutral,undefined
I thought I aggravated you most of the time.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"So, uh, just read this part.",Client,neutral,undefined
You know what? We... I'm sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Ah, you're not gonna do it.",Client,neutral,undefined
I understand that you're anxious.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, you understand but you won't help me.",Client,anger,undefined
I would like to help you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I just don't think that it's appropriate... - I know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, I just won't do anything.",Client,anger,undefined
Frances.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What? I'm about to be embarrassed in front of 1200 people.,Client,anger,undefined
"I have no one in my life who's willing to help me,",Client,anger,undefined
And that obviously includes you.,Client,anger,undefined
"So, uh, just read this part.",Client,neutral,undefined

And that obviously includes you.,Client,anger,undefined
You're sure you don't have any ibuprofen?,Client,depression,undefined
I don't. I'm sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
What about the other stuff?,Client,depression,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I have water.</i>,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Unbelievable.,Client,depression,undefined
Would you like some water?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's... it's... it's...,Client,depression,undefined
It's really crazy when you think about it.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, you're a doctor.",Client,depression,undefined
You prescribed me sleeping pills two weeks ago.,Client,depression,undefined
"And if I needed morphine, I know you could get me some.",Client,depression,undefined
But you can't give me two aspirin.,Client,depression,undefined
I already said I don't have any.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You still feel I'm denying you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm just... I'm not up to this today.,Client,depression,undefined
Why do you think I would do that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Cruelty maybe,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Uh, power, control,",Client,neutral,undefined
Youthful clinging to protocol.,Client,neutral,undefined
My father used to do the same thing.,Client,depression,undefined
"If ever I got sick, or my brother did,",Client,depression,undefined
He'd never write out a prescription.,Client,disgust,undefined
He'd always send us to the clinic,Client,disgust,undefined
For an antibiotic.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you get headaches a lot?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, I do lately.",Client,neutral,undefined
How often?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sometimes three in a week.,Client,neutral,undefined
"That's another Parkinson's symptom, by the way.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Not all the Web sites list it,",Client,neutral,undefined
But I found five or six that do.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So we've got tremor, rigidity,",Client,disgust,undefined
"Frequent headaches,",Client,disgust,undefined
Loss of sense of smell... that's a fun one.,Client,disgust,undefined
You've been researching online.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was. Now I'm...,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not.,Client,neutral,undefined
You mean...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I mean I'm stopping.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've stopped.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why is that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
How about an ice pack?,Client,neutral,undefined
"You wouldn't refuse me an ice pack, would you?",Client,neutral,undefined
"If you really feel you can't continue, we should...",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"No no, it's okay. I was just kidding,",Client,neutral,undefined
Sort of.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'll muster through.,Client,neutral,undefined
So where... where were we?,Client,neutral,undefined
Your research.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Oh yes, the joyful discovery",Client,neutral,undefined
That headaches are a symptom of Parkinson's.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's one possible explanation.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I'm gonna ask the new neurologist.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm seeing him on the 7th.,Client,neutral,undefined
Could there be others?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Other neurologists?,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't doubt it.,Client,neutral,undefined
Other explanations for your headaches.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How are things at home with...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Max.,Client,neutral,undefined
My son's name is Max.,Client,neutral,undefined
I remember.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
You do?,Client,neutral,undefined
You do?,Client,neutral,undefined
I just saw you were kind of searching for it there.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, I wasn't.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So how are things at home?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you remember I told you,Client,neutral,undefined
"About my teenage patient, the adopted one?",Client,neutral,undefined
Jesse.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, he showed up with a black eye this week.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Seems he got into a big fight,",Client,neutral,undefined
Suspended from school.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you bring him up?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I've been worried about him.,Client,neutral,undefined
I... I don't see what the problem is.,Client,neutral,undefined
I asked how things were at home,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And you moved on to your teenage patient.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You asked me if there were other reasons,Client,neutral,undefined
Why I've been suffering from headaches.,Client,neutral,undefined
You sit with Jesse,Client,neutral,undefined
And you'll know he's a valid answer.,Client,neutral,undefined
I've been concerned about his treatment.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm just not certain anymore,Client,depression,undefined
That I'm the right person to help him.,Client,depression,undefined
"Truth is, he might be better off",Client,neutral,undefined
If he were seeing you instead...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Seeing anyone else, really.",Client,neutral,undefined
I actually came here today,Client,neutral,undefined
To ask your opinion.,Client,neutral,undefined
Earlier you said you came back because of Max.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Earlier as in...,Client,neutral,undefined
Last week.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You said he was your reason,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
For returning to therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said you wanted to discuss,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How best to tell him about your illness.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You know...,Client,depression,undefined
You seem upset.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Have you been reading Gina's book?,Client,depression,undefined
Have you been reading Gina's book?,Client,depression,undefined
I'm sorry?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Gina's book,",Client,depression,undefined
Her critically acclaimed,Client,depression,undefined
Deeply deluded work of fiction.,Client,depression,undefined
I told you that's her big theory...,Client,disgust,undefined
That I invested in my patients,Client,disgust,undefined
At the expense of real relationships.,Client,disgust,undefined
I remember it upset you she gave a character these shortcomings.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Oh yeah, it upset me. Do you know why?",Client,disgust,undefined
Because it's horseshit.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, I can worry about my patients",Client,anger,undefined
And still be there for my son.,Client,anger,undefined
I'm... I'm...,Client,anger,undefined
"You know, I'm perfectly capable",Client,anger,undefined
Of doing two things at once.,Client,anger,undefined
"In fact, I was just out with Max last night",Client,anger,undefined
To see his favorite band.,Client,anger,undefined
How was that?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was fine.,Client,depression,undefined
It was loud.,Client,depression,undefined
"It, you know, was...",Client,depression,undefined
"What was it? Every time I bring up Max, you seem to...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Christ, I'm not trying to avoid your questions about Max,",Client,anger,undefined
I promise you that.,Client,anger,undefined
And the connection with Jesse will make sense,Client,anger,undefined
If you'd just let me get to it.,Client,anger,undefined
Of course. Please.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Okay,",Client,disgust,undefined
Two days ago Jesse brings his mother in.,Client,disgust,undefined
His...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Adoptive mother.,Client,disgust,undefined
He's trying to get me to tell her about his birth mother's phone call.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Of course, I didn't want to do that.",Client,disgust,undefined
So Jesse finally blurts out the news himself.,Client,disgust,undefined
His mother flees the room immediately.,Client,disgust,undefined
Then Jesse accuses me of taking her side.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you think that's...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He's right.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I didn't realize it at the time, but...",Client,disgust,undefined
"You see what's going on here, I'm sure.",Client,disgust,undefined
It's perfectly obvious what's at play.,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm not certain I...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Okay.,Client,disgust,undefined
Here's this woman. She's sitting across from me.,Client,disgust,undefined
Her son is struggling.,Client,disgust,undefined
She's spent years raising this kid...,Client,disgust,undefined
"Feeding him, clothing him,",Client,disgust,undefined
Trying to do the best she can,Client,disgust,undefined
"To, you know, connect with him.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Then in comes this other person,",Client,disgust,undefined
"Swoops in, trying to claim him as her own.",Client,disgust,undefined
Of course I felt for her.,Client,disgust,undefined
You know? How could I not?,Client,disgust,undefined
You're talking about Kate's fiance.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Steve.,Client,depression,undefined
"You feel he's swooping in,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Trying to claim your children.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He's done his best.,Client,neutral,undefined
So clearly I'm less than objective here.,Client,neutral,undefined
My question for you is...,Client,neutral,undefined
Can I still,Client,neutral,undefined
Treat Jesse effectively?,Client,neutral,undefined
You're asking my advice,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
About your practice?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm asking your opinion.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm asking you whether you think,Client,neutral,undefined
I've lost my objectivity.,Client,neutral,undefined
All right?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, you must have some opinion.",Client,neutral,undefined
"What, are you so appalled by my admission",Client,neutral,undefined
That you're not even going to address it?,Client,neutral,undefined
I think the question you're asking,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is one you might ask a supervisor.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And what does that mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
You're asking me to step outside my role as your therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I know with Gina this was...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Oh, we're back to Gina again.",Client,disgust,undefined
May I finish?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Sure, go ahead.",Client,neutral,undefined
I know this was common practice with Gina.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm not Gina.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You say you're finding it hard,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
To be objective with Jesse.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You know this has a lot to do,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
With your feelings about Max and Steve.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You point this out. You make the connection.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But then you'd rather not look at it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe you can tell me some more about Steve.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I don't know what exactly there is to say about him,Client,neutral,undefined
Except he's made my son miserable.,Client,neutral,undefined
Has Max told you that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
In his own words.,Client,disgust,undefined
Which were what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That the guy's a total putz,",Client,disgust,undefined
"He's a warlock, a republican.",Client,disgust,undefined
Should I keep going?,Client,neutral,undefined
If you like.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"As soon as he bought Kate her ring,",Client,disgust,undefined
The warlock decided they should move into his castle.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Oh, he's an architect",Client,disgust,undefined
And very proud of this modern monstrosity,Client,disgust,undefined
"That he built in Aberdeen, Maryland.",Client,disgust,undefined
"So he announces they're all gonna live there,",Client,disgust,undefined
"Starting immediately,",Client,disgust,undefined
Even though Aberdeen is 40 minutes outside the city,Client,disgust,undefined
And Anour's bus ride from Max's school,Client,disgust,undefined
And the few friends that he has.,Client,disgust,undefined
And Max isn't happy with this arrangement?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He traveled 200 miles alone on the train to prove it.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how have things been since he got here?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Last week I signed Max up for school.,Client,disgust,undefined
I told you... a decent place around the corner.,Client,disgust,undefined
It's the third highest test scores in Brooklyn.,Client,disgust,undefined
But Kate and the republican... they don't approve.,Client,disgust,undefined
So she calls me twice a day to say that he's gonna pay for poly prep...,Client,disgust,undefined
Which is a mer 30 grand a year.,Client,disgust,undefined
And last time she lets it drop,Client,disgust,undefined
That he's prepared to cover college.,Client,disgust,undefined
This feels threatening?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, I guess I should be relieved,",Client,disgust,undefined
Let him support my kids for life.,Client,disgust,undefined
And I'll just retire tomorrow.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you want to retire?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sometimes.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, I've been trying to talk to you",Client,depression,undefined
"About how poor a job I might be doing,",Client,depression,undefined
"Whether I'm failing certain patients,",Client,depression,undefined
But you're kind of making it clear,Client,depression,undefined
That you don't want to discuss that.,Client,depression,undefined
I wonder if you feel,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You may be failing your son too.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Steve's presence obviously has affected your relationship.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Can you tell me what disturbs you most about...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Apart from the fact that he's trying to buy my son's love,",Client,disgust,undefined
That he thinks he knows better,Client,disgust,undefined
What's right for my kid?,Client,disgust,undefined
It shouldn't be too hard to grasp,Client,disgust,undefined
What my problem is with Jesse...,Client,disgust,undefined
Why I don't know if I can treat him.,Client,disgust,undefined
'cause I see him obsessed,Client,disgust,undefined
"With this new parent figure,",Client,disgust,undefined
Rejecting the people who raised him.,Client,disgust,undefined
But Max hasn't rejected you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He chose to live with you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He hasn't withdrawn. He's come closer.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, geographically closer, yes.",Client,depression,undefined
He still feels distant?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing's changed this week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He's still the same...,Client,depression,undefined
"Drawing, sleeping, monosyllabic.",Client,depression,undefined
He was out of school for a couple days,Client,depression,undefined
With a cold.,Client,depression,undefined
It's not that.,Client,depression,undefined
It bothers you deeply to see him unhappy.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You said you took him out last night.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How was he then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you know animal collective?,Client,joy,undefined
Do you know animal collective?,Client,joy,undefined
I'm gonna assume that's a band.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Max told me last month that he'd missed them,Client,depression,undefined
When they played in Baltimore,Client,depression,undefined
Because of his mother and Steve's engagement party.,Client,depression,undefined
So I saw that they were playing here,Client,depression,undefined
And I got tickets.,Client,depression,undefined
It was the craziest scene...,Client,depression,undefined
400 hypercharged kids,Client,depression,undefined
And a few traumatized parents.,Client,depression,undefined
"All the other kids were going berserk,",Client,depression,undefined
"Rushing the edge of the stage,",Client,depression,undefined
"Crushed together, screaming frantically.",Client,depression,undefined
And Max?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Max stayed pinned to my side.,Client,depression,undefined
"He went closer when I prodded him, but...",Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, he kept coming back to check on me.",Client,depression,undefined
So I'd send him off again,Client,depression,undefined
"And he'd go stand at the edge of things,",Client,depression,undefined
"Against the side wall, with his hood on.",Client,depression,undefined
It was...,Client,sadness,undefined
It was just hard for me to watch him.,Client,sadness,undefined
This is his favorite band?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
You say it was hard for you to watch him.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Can you tell me why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I'm his father.,Client,depression,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
He's my son.,Client,depression,undefined
You're asking me why it was hard for me to see him unhappy.,Client,sadness,undefined
Clearly you haven't had kids.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm asking if you can describe in more detail,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What it felt like to watch him.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said he kept coming back to check on you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Why do you think that is?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was deafened by the noise.,Client,depression,undefined
And...,Client,depression,undefined
I couldn't help wondering how Sunil...,Client,depression,undefined
What he would make of all this.,Client,depression,undefined
Sunil? Your patient?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Right.,Client,depression,undefined
Why do you bring him up?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I kept seeing the whole thing through his eyes...,Client,disgust,undefined
"The assault of it, the frenzy.",Client,disgust,undefined
It was so...,Client,disgust,undefined
"So extreme, so...",Client,disgust,undefined
So American.,Client,depression,undefined
"I know exactly how he feels,",Client,depression,undefined
Why he locks himself off in that room.,Client,depression,undefined
And you think Max somehow picked up on this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That's why he kept coming back to check on you?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Surely you weren't the only parent,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Standing uncomfortably in the back.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I... I guess I'm not so clear,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why Max would be so concerned.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you all right?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Paul.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I...,Client,depression,undefined
I made a terrible mistake.,Client,depression,undefined
I made a terrible mistake.,Client,depression,undefined
Tell me.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I let Max use my computer before we left,Client,fear,undefined
"To find the directions to the concert,",Client,fear,undefined
And I...,Client,fear,undefined
I didn't realize I hadn't cleared,Client,fear,undefined
The searches from the list,Client,fear,undefined
From the... the history.,Client,fear,undefined
So I walk into the room,Client,fear,undefined
"And he's scrolling through this list of searches,",Client,fear,undefined
"Hundreds of them... Parkinson's institute,",Client,fear,undefined
Parkinson's disease foundation.,Client,fear,undefined
I know all of them by heart.,Client,fear,undefined
And...,Client,fear,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I just... I just knew from his face,Client,fear,undefined
Exactly what he'd seen.,Client,fear,undefined
And he...,Client,fear,undefined
Asked me...,Client,fear,undefined
If I was sick.,Client,fear,undefined
What did you say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I said no.,Client,fear,undefined
I said it... that wasn't about me.,Client,fear,undefined
I was researching for a patient.,Client,fear,undefined
But Max is... he's exceptionally bright.,Client,fear,undefined
It's never been easy to lie to him.,Client,fear,undefined
"His sister's seven years older,",Client,neutral,undefined
And he told her there was no tooth fairy.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you consider telling him the truth?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was just in shock.,Client,depression,undefined
And he was just looking at me,Client,depression,undefined
With his big eyes.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I thought,",Client,depression,undefined
he's scared.,Client,depression,undefined
"Get through the moment, get out the door,",Client,depression,undefined
"See the concert. You can ruin his life later,",Client,depression,undefined
Not like this though. Not right now.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, it's fucking crazy...",Client,disgust,undefined
"All this time I'm consumed with how best to break it,",Client,disgust,undefined
"And then to have it happen like this,",Client,disgust,undefined
In...,Client,disgust,undefined
In the worst possible way.,Client,disgust,undefined
Was that the entire conversation?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Pretty much.,Client,depression,undefined
We got home. I put him to bed.,Client,depression,undefined
And I went to my computer,Client,depression,undefined
And I just erased the whole history.,Client,depression,undefined
Then I had a drink.,Client,depression,undefined
And then,Client,depression,undefined
I had a few more.,Client,depression,undefined
And then I went to sleep.,Client,depression,undefined
And I didn't wake up till Max called me for school.,Client,depression,undefined
So there.,Client,depression,undefined
There's your other explanation,Client,depression,undefined
For my now splitting headache.,Client,depression,undefined
"It is worse, having told me?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I shouldn't have had those drinks. I know that.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't drink alone.,Client,depression,undefined
After the night that I had...,Client,depression,undefined
You said you went to bed after your drinks,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And slept till morning.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's right.,Client,depression,undefined
You didn't wake up?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you have your dream?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I... I... I... I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
I may have.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't remember really.,Client,depression,undefined
Am I right that this is the first time,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You were able to sleep well in months?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I guess I've got the whisky to thank for that.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm wondering if there's another reason,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were able to sleep well,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Quite apart from the alcohol.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why do I have the feeling that I'm not gonna like this?,Client,depression,undefined
You mentioned that in the morning,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It was Max who woke you up.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Mm-hmm.,Client,depression,undefined
Does he usually wake you up or...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was late. I was sleeping.,Client,disgust,undefined
It was late. I was sleeping.,Client,disgust,undefined
I understand. What I'm ask...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
he was late for school.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I was sleeping. You know, I don't know what you're getting at.",Client,disgust,undefined
What I'm try...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
it isn't relevant.,Client,anger,undefined
It isn't meaningful. It was just a hangover.,Client,anger,undefined
You're speaking very loudly.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Sorry.,Client,neutral,undefined
Are you suggesting that I left my Internet history up,Client,depression,undefined
"On purpose, for Max to discover?",Client,depression,undefined
I think it can be a dead end to try to ascribe intentionality.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Let's just...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"oh Jesus, come on. Listen to you.",Client,disgust,undefined
You sound like a textbook...,Client,disgust,undefined
when patient tries to ascribe...,Client,disgust,undefined
Damn it.,Client,disgust,undefined
Damn it.,Client,disgust,undefined
Are you all right?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,depression,undefined
Would you like some water?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, thank you.",Client,depression,undefined
Let's talk about the effects,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Max's discovery has had on you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
The scene you described to me...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Max coming to check on you at the concert,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Getting you up in the morning...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Does that dynamic seem familiar to you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
A child caring for a parent.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"When, you said, your own mother wasn't well",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You had to take care of her when you were young.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And now here's Max taking care of you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Can you tell me what you're thinking?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Honestly?,Client,depression,undefined
Please.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I wish I could tell you to go fuck yourself.,Client,depression,undefined
I wish I could tell you to go fuck yourself.,Client,depression,undefined
What's stopping you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know what you must think of me.,Client,depression,undefined
What must I think of you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm subjecting my son to the same misery I went through.,Client,disgust,undefined
Not only that but I...,Client,disgust,undefined
I'm getting some kind of,Client,depression,undefined
"Comfort from it,",Client,depression,undefined
Sleeping like a baby through the night.,Client,depression,undefined
I mean...,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know how you can stand to look at me.,Client,depression,undefined
"When I look at you,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I see a father profoundly concerned for his son.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Fuck. Fuck it.,Client,disgust,undefined
Fuck.,Client,disgust,undefined
I've got to meet Max in 20 minutes.,Client,depression,undefined
I have to take him to Penn station for a 6:50 train.,Client,depression,undefined
He's spending the weekend,Client,depression,undefined
With Kate and Steve.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know if I can face him.,Client,depression,undefined
What frightens you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That he's gonna look up at me,Client,depression,undefined
And pretend...,Client,depression,undefined
Just pretend that everything is fine,Client,depression,undefined
When the truth is,Client,depression,undefined
That he's worrying that I'm dying.,Client,depression,undefined
He'll be thinking,Client,depression,undefined
If I'm unfit to be his father.,Client,depression,undefined
Are you unfit to be his father?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think you've been working very hard,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To prove you're unfit...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"To yourself, to your neurologist, to Max,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How to you?,Client,depression,undefined
"Since you came in today,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You've tried to get me to take care of you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You've asked me for painkillers.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You even imagined I'd give you morphine.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You asked for help with one of your patients,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Even suggesting I would do a better job with one of them,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Despite the fact,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"As you are very fond of pointing out,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You have 20 years of clinical experience over me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think I'm beginning to understand,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"How the dynamic between you and Gina developed,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
How she came to play,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
So many roles in your life...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Supervisor, mentor, therapist,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Mother.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
How was it you say she presented you in the novel?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Needy, childish,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Poor husband, deficient father?",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Is it possible that you convinced her,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"That you were, in fact, incapable?",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
That you've convinced yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Why would I do that?,Client,depression,undefined
Why would I do that?,Client,depression,undefined
You said Max's train's at 6:50?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, I should...",Client,depression,undefined
I should go get him.,Client,depression,undefined
"Paul, we'll talk next week.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
"Hello, Sunil.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Hello.,Client,neutral,undefined
I... I prepared some tea.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Thank you so much, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
You... you're taking birth control pills?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I'm not, no.",Client,neutral,undefined
Are you feeding your Lily plant?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No no, my plant is thriving already, don't worry.",Client,neutral,undefined
I found them in Julia's study.,Client,neutral,undefined
In Julia's study?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And she's quite private about this mysterious room.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She keeps it so clean and organized,",Client,neutral,undefined
it's like...,Client,neutral,undefined
It's difficult...,Client,neutral,undefined
It's like entering a personal museum.,Client,neutral,undefined
And Arun is the only one who is allowed to go in there,Client,neutral,undefined
when he brings her cappuccino.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you went in there?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, do you remember Mr. pale fox?",Client,neutral,undefined
Pale fox... Do you remember pale fox?,Client,neutral,undefined
You mean Ethan Barr.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So now he has written another book.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's called the young boy and the cave.,Client,neutral,undefined
All week she was on the phone,Client,neutral,undefined
with such passion in her voice,Client,neutral,undefined
and speaking of it to Arun and her colleagues,Client,neutral,undefined
as if it is David Copperfield.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, how pitch-perfect it is.",Client,neutral,undefined
Oh genius. Genius.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So when you went into Julia's study,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
is that what you were looking for... Ethan Barr's manuscript?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It is supposedly about a young boy,Client,neutral,undefined
who gets lost in a cave,Client,neutral,undefined
and who discovers a group,Client,neutral,undefined
of displaced American veterans from the Iraq war,Client,neutral,undefined
who are inventing a game,Client,neutral,undefined
using a giant ball,Client,neutral,undefined
made of their shaved hair and shoelaces.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she goes on and on about how the men,Client,neutral,undefined
who are inventing the game are so heartbreaking,Client,neutral,undefined
because they are trying to regain their innocence,Client,neutral,undefined
and playing this game would somehow reverse,Client,neutral,undefined
all the terrible things they did in the war.,Client,neutral,undefined
So apparently they teach the boy how to play the game.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then the boy teaches them,Client,neutral,undefined
how to become boys again.,Client,neutral,undefined
See how pitch-perfect it is?,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you consider asking your daughter-in-law,Therapist,neutral,Open question
if you could read the book?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you read it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, I... I... I did not locate it.",Client,neutral,undefined
But I can assure you this is ridiculous.,Client,neutral,undefined
Yet you still felt compelled,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"to search for it in Julia's study, yeah?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And this is what I found.,Client,neutral,undefined
And this is an absolute proof,Client,neutral,undefined
that Julia is having an affair,Client,neutral,undefined
"with Mr. pale fox, a.K.A. Ethan Barr.",Client,neutral,undefined
Don't you think it's at all possible,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that Julia might be taking these pills,Therapist,neutral,Open question
because she and your son have chosen to,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in order not to get pregnant?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Arun has told me more than once,Client,neutral,undefined
that he wished to have another son.,Client,neutral,undefined
And need I remind you,Client,neutral,undefined
that when I moved in their home,Client,neutral,undefined
it was clearly stated,Client,neutral,undefined
that my room on the third floor was temporary;,Client,neutral,undefined
and it would be,Client,neutral,undefined
eventually transformed into the new baby's room,Client,neutral,undefined
and I would move down to the basement? Do you remember?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, I remember you told me that, yeah.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"If this is indeed the case,",Client,anger,undefined
then can somebody please explain to me,Client,anger,undefined
why Julia is using contraception's?,Client,anger,undefined
"If Julia intends to have another child with my son,",Client,anger,undefined
she should be trying to do so.,Client,anger,undefined
But clearly this is not her wish.,Client,anger,undefined
This obviously upsets you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
This aspect of Julia and Arun's private life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He's my son.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I understand that, Sunil, but he is also a married man.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
And the issues of contraception and childbearing...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Surely they're between him and Julia.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Isn't it rightfully their business?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And not mine?,Client,anger,undefined
I have nothing to do with it?,Client,anger,undefined
I'm not sure that they would think so.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm his father. Sir.,Client,anger,undefined
I understand that you are...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm his father. It's my family too!,Client,anger,undefined
I'm his father. It's my family too!,Client,anger,undefined
No one can erase this fact...,Client,anger,undefined
That I'm his father!,Client,anger,undefined
"Knowing what I know, how can I not be concerned, Paul?",Client,anger,undefined
She is taking these pills secretly.,Client,disgust,undefined
They were not found in the medicine chest of her bathroom.,Client,disgust,undefined
They were not on her bedside table.,Client,disgust,undefined
They were hidden in a drawer,Client,disgust,undefined
under some papers in her study.,Client,disgust,undefined
Now I can only conclude,Client,disgust,undefined
that she is conducting an affair.,Client,disgust,undefined
Mightn't there be another reason?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm just not sure,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that as evidence the pills alone indicate...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You need more evidence?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Okay, why else would she be taking them? Tell me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, sometimes women go on the pill",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to alleviate certain hormonal symptoms.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It can also protect against several cancers,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and it also minimizes...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Julia is perfectly healthy, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
How do you know that? Do you know her medical history?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No no, she is not a sick person. I know what it is like",Client,neutral,undefined
"to be around someone who's ill,",Client,neutral,undefined
and believe me...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, I...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I believe... I believe you, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"When I think of them together,",Client,disgust,undefined
my hand turns into a fist.,Client,disgust,undefined
When you think of Julia and Ethan?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Something happens to me. My heart starts to race.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why are you looking at me strangely?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm simply aware of,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
how angry all this makes you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I thought you would be pleased,Client,neutral,undefined
that I have become an angry person.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why would I be pleased about that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No no, perhaps I was wrong.",Client,neutral,undefined
Perhaps I...,Client,neutral,undefined
I misunderstood.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I know that I have encouraged you",Therapist,neutral,Approval
to more directly express your feelings.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I had this very strange dream...,Client,depression,undefined
A very strange dream.,Client,depression,undefined
And I was...,Client,depression,undefined
I was quite disturbed by it.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Would you like to tell me about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"You know, there was a dark-coated animal",Client,fear,undefined
lying on the shore of the sea.,Client,fear,undefined
And I could not decipher,Client,fear,undefined
whether it's a goat or a dog.,Client,fear,undefined
"It was injured, perhaps dying.",Client,fear,undefined
It was having great difficulty breathing.,Client,fear,undefined
There was a tall cliff behind me.,Client,fear,undefined
And I had the sense that the animal,Client,fear,undefined
had fallen a great distance.,Client,fear,undefined
And I was standing over it with a large stick.,Client,fear,undefined
I started to manipulate the body.,Client,fear,undefined
Manipulate?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was poking and prodding it.,Client,fear,undefined
Even now I cannot determine,Client,fear,undefined
whether I was trying to harm or revive her.,Client,fear,undefined
"And before me, the sea was starting to rise.",Client,fear,undefined
And I had the sense that...,Client,fear,undefined
That I was losing time.,Client,fear,undefined
What does that mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,fear,undefined
"Before I realized what had happened,",Client,fear,undefined
I was in the backyard of my son's house.,Client,fear,undefined
And I was digging a hole with my bare hands.,Client,fear,undefined
And I was digging so desperately and intensely,Client,fear,undefined
that I could feel my tongue swelling in my mouth.,Client,fear,undefined
"Then I reached to put the animal in the hole,",Client,fear,undefined
but it was too dark. I could not locate it.,Client,fear,undefined
And then,Client,fear,undefined
I realized I had already.,Client,fear,undefined
"I cannot say what it was, but it felt...",Client,fear,undefined
It felt as if it was,Client,fear,undefined
very very important to me.,Client,fear,undefined
And then Arun was... My son...,Client,fear,undefined
Arun was suddenly approaching.,Client,fear,undefined
"He was coming towards me quickly,",Client,fear,undefined
and his eyes were enormous.,Client,fear,undefined
I felt that I had done,Client,fear,undefined
something terribly wrong.,Client,fear,undefined
And I woke up.,Client,fear,undefined
"When I woke up, I could still feel",Client,fear,undefined
the soil under my fingernails.,Client,fear,undefined
You're quiet.,Client,neutral,undefined
You have no reaction to the dream I just told you?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd rather hear your reaction.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I could not fall back asleep,",Client,neutral,undefined
so I went down the hall to Arun and Julia's room.,Client,neutral,undefined
My son and his wife sleep,Client,neutral,undefined
"turned away from each other,",Client,neutral,undefined
as if they have been thrown,Client,neutral,undefined
from opposite sides of a speeding car.,Client,neutral,undefined
My son's breathing is labored.,Client,neutral,undefined
He snores powerfully.,Client,neutral,undefined
But Julia...,Client,neutral,undefined
What... what about Julia?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She sleeps so easily, Paul,",Client,neutral,undefined
as if nothing can hurt her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"While she keeps this secret from my son,",Client,disgust,undefined
she sleeps with such peace on her face.,Client,disgust,undefined
Can I ask you how long you were watching them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe 15 minutes.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then I could not fall back asleep,Client,neutral,undefined
for the rest of the night.,Client,neutral,undefined
And my mind kept returning to the dream.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you mind if we discussed the dream a little bit more?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you see terrible omens?,Client,neutral,undefined
Omens.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I simply thought that we could make,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
some associations.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Associations?,Client,neutral,undefined
Can you... Can you tell me...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can you tell me a little more,Therapist,neutral,Open question
about the animal that you saw in the dream?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You said that you weren't quite sure,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
whether it was a goat or a dog.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yes, I only know that it had a dark coat",Client,depression,undefined
and that it had great difficulty breathing.,Client,depression,undefined
Like Arun?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said that his breathing was labored,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
while you watched him sleep.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You think the animal in my dream was Arun?,Client,depression,undefined
You think the animal in my dream was Arun?,Client,depression,undefined
You said that the animal was in a state of decline.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And you also gave it a gender.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Did I?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, when you were standing over this animal",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"with a stick,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you called it a her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So now you think the animal is Julia?,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know. Is that what you think?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you have the dream the night you found the pills?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, you're right.",Client,neutral,undefined
What else do you think,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that the dream might indicate?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You want to smoke?,Client,neutral,undefined
Oh no.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's very light.,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, thank you.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"You talked about the sense that time was running out,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"both at the shore and at your son's house,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
as he was walking towards you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you referred to this sense of desperation.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Hmm, time.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Time, yes.",Client,neutral,undefined
There's never enough... Never.,Client,neutral,undefined
Time to do what?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"That's the question,",Client,depression,undefined
isn't it?,Client,depression,undefined
What is there to do?,Client,depression,undefined
I find that smoking makes me calm.,Client,neutral,undefined
Cigarettes have this effect on me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Would you... Would you mind,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
if we continued to talk about the dream?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I started smoking when I was in university.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did I tell you that?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, you did.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You told me the first day that you came to see me.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Well, I'm pleased to see that you remember",Client,neutral,undefined
"the things that I say to you, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
You also remember the woman I mentioned to you... Malini?,Client,neutral,undefined
So you'd rather talk about Malini?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"In my final year, I followed her out of the library.",Client,neutral,undefined
I... I watched her light a cigarette.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I thought to myself,",Client,neutral,undefined
I must learn to smoke so that I can talk to her.,Client,neutral,undefined
I suppose there are worse reasons people start to smoke.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
One afternoon we went to watch Satyajit Ray's film.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Afterwards we went to a cafe, then we smoked cigarettes,",Client,neutral,undefined
then we discussed the theme of the movie.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I thought I was being so sophisticated.,Client,neutral,undefined
And Malini smoked with such ease.,Client,neutral,undefined
And you must know one thing... in those days,Client,neutral,undefined
it was extremely rare for a woman to smoke outside.,Client,neutral,undefined
And the look on her face when she drew the smoke into her lungs...,Client,neutral,undefined
It was like as if she knew,Client,neutral,undefined
some great secret.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I smoked like my eyelashes were on fire.,Client,neutral,undefined
I could watch her smoke all day...,Client,neutral,undefined
All day.,Client,neutral,undefined
Last week you mentioned that the relationship,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
between you and Malini had to end.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yes, this is true.",Client,neutral,undefined
What is the American phrase...,Client,neutral,undefined
All good things must end badly?,Client,neutral,undefined
All good things must come to an end.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But it's kind of interesting the way you phrase it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did things end badly?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was Brahmin. She was not.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was from a different caste.,Client,neutral,undefined
So she was from a lower caste than yours.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
The caste system was established,Client,neutral,undefined
to keep the societal order.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was an only child... An only son of my family.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I knew they were not going to approve.,Client,neutral,undefined
And did you know she was from another caste when you met her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of course.,Client,neutral,undefined
But it made no difference.,Client,neutral,undefined
I...,Client,neutral,undefined
I could not resist her.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wanted to spend each and every moment of my life with her.,Client,neutral,undefined
We studied together. We took walks together.,Client,neutral,undefined
We went to the cinema.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And sometimes we did nothing,",Client,neutral,undefined
but that was okay too.,Client,neutral,undefined
Mm-hmm.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So were you... Were you intimate?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sunil?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I should not have been.,Client,depression,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Perhaps we should continue discussing my dream.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, we can,",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
but I would like you to tell me,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
what happened with Malini first.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
She ended our relationship.,Client,depression,undefined
She did?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And how did she end the relationship?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She...,Client,depression,undefined
She...,Client,depression,undefined
I agreed to meet her on the steps of the library.,Client,depression,undefined
So I thought she was going to surprise me,Client,depression,undefined
with a gift or a note or...,Client,depression,undefined
But she told me she could no longer see me.,Client,depression,undefined
"I pleaded with her to reconsider,",Client,depression,undefined
but we had a terrible argument,Client,depression,undefined
and she walked away,Client,depression,undefined
wearing my coat.,Client,depression,undefined
I felt like someone was pulling,Client,sadness,undefined
a spool of hot thread,Client,sadness,undefined
through my heart.,Client,sadness,undefined
And that was the last time I ever saw her.,Client,sadness,undefined
"But, Sunil, I have to point out",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that this contradicts what you told me during the last session.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Last week when you were talking about Malini,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you said that you had made a great sacrifice.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said that you hadn't got any patience for people,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
who put their desires before their principles.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But now it seems that the choice,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
was not yours to make.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did you ever make any attempt,Therapist,neutral,Open question
to contact her again after she walked away?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why are you so interested in Malini?,Client,depression,undefined
Why does she fascinate you?,Client,depression,undefined
Leave her. Let her go.,Client,depression,undefined
"Because when you talk about her,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I see a side of you that I haven't seen before.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, it's not really there, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
"This side of me, as you say, it's...",Client,depression,undefined
You're talking to a ghost.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't think that's true.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think the part of you that loved Malini,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is deeply hidden.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why do you say a ghost?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sunil?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
There's a bridge in Calcutta.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's called the Howrah bridge.,Client,sadness,undefined
There's a bridge in Calcutta.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's called the Howrah bridge.,Client,sadness,undefined
"It spans the Hooghly river,",Client,sadness,undefined
which links,Client,sadness,undefined
Howrah city and Calcutta.,Client,sadness,undefined
My family was from the other side.,Client,sadness,undefined
She threw herself from the bridge,Client,sadness,undefined
and drowned.,Client,sadness,undefined
"When they found her body at the bottom of the river,",Client,sadness,undefined
she was still wearing the same jacket...,Client,sadness,undefined
When she left.,Client,sadness,undefined
I don't know why.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Yeah, I know.",Client,sadness,undefined
There were heavy stones in her pockets...,Client,sadness,undefined
In the pockets of the jacket.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm so very sorry.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Why are you sorry? You didn't know her.,Client,sadness,undefined
I'm sorry for you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why?,Client,sadness,undefined
For the pain that you experienced;,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for the pain that you still carry with you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The pain that I still carry?,Client,sadness,undefined
I... I didn't realize that...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That she'd killed herself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You told me the last time,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that you'd never spoken about this to anybody.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
No.,Client,sadness,undefined
The police spoke to me.,Client,sadness,undefined
There was a brief investigation.,Client,sadness,undefined
An investigation?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
They knew Malini and I spent time together.,Client,depression,undefined
My mother had stitched my name,Client,depression,undefined
into the lining of my jacket.,Client,depression,undefined
Hmm.,Client,depression,undefined
They were curious like you.,Client,depression,undefined
But nothing came out of the investigation.,Client,depression,undefined
A few months later I graduated with honors.,Client,depression,undefined
Kamala and I were married soon after.,Client,depression,undefined
So you've had to live with this...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
This awful tragedy privately,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for the past 30 years?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"32 years, actually.",Client,sadness,undefined
But it's nothing. It's simply a scar.,Client,sadness,undefined
It's more than just a scar.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Malini was obviously somebody,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you were deeply connected to.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She ended the relationship,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and she took her own life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Just to go back to the dream for a moment...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You said that the animal fell,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
from a high cliff.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
And Malini fell to her death,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
from a bridge.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Yes.,Client,sadness,undefined
When you talk about Malini,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"and the passion of your relationship,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
it reminds me of how you described,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
your son and Julia when they first came to visit you in Calcutta.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"See, Paul, please please",Client,disgust,undefined
don't compare my relationship with Malini to Arun and Julia.,Client,disgust,undefined
"Listen, this is preposterous.",Client,disgust,undefined
"With all due respect, Sunil,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't think it is.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You said that you never talked about Malini with anybody,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
since the police investigation.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Now here you are, talking to me",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
32 years later.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't think that's a coincidence.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I think maybe something in the way,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that Julia and Arun relate to each other...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The intimacy with which they relate...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Reminds you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
of your own intimacy,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
with Malini.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And that perhaps...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Perhaps that may be one of the reasons,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
why you feel so conflicted,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
in your relationship to your daughter-in-law.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
( Sighs ),Client,sadness,undefined
Maybe.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Maybe, Paul.",Client,sadness,undefined
I don't know.,Client,sadness,undefined
But what I do know without question is,Client,sadness,undefined
it is more and more difficult,Client,sadness,undefined
"for me to live in the presence of Julia,",Client,sadness,undefined
to continue living in her...,Client,sadness,undefined
In her house.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Yeah, I understand.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Well, is there anything that we can discuss",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
that might improve that situation?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"See, I have already told you there's...",Client,sadness,undefined
There's nothing to be done.,Client,sadness,undefined
I have no options.,Client,sadness,undefined
I must go now.,Client,sadness,undefined
There's... there's still a little time left.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"I have to return these pills, you know, before she notices.",Client,neutral,undefined
You've obviously been through a lot,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in the last... In the last week...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Finding these pills, the intensity of your dream.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
If these emotions have stirred anything,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
that makes you feel overwhelmed...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
What does that mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, if you're continuing to have trouble sleeping, for example,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
or if you have disturbing thoughts,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"or any more of these dreams that keep you awake,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
I just want you to know that you can call me.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
And perhaps after you return these pills,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"in Julia's drawer,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
you should think about,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
not going into her study again.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Goodbye.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Thank you.,Client,neutral,undefined
You cut your hair.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's different. It's lighter.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Darker, for the play.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's very... very becoming.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Well, it's becoming Maxine, not me.",Client,joy,undefined
"You know, I look in the mirror,",Client,neutral,undefined
wear the shirt. It helps me to find her reality.,Client,neutral,undefined
Not that that reality is,Client,joy,undefined
"all that different than my reality, but...",Client,joy,undefined
What do you mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She's recently widowed,",Client,neutral,undefined
"all alone in the world,",Client,neutral,undefined
sex-starved.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, I am... Well, there are overlaps.",Client,joy,undefined
Overlaps?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you think that has anything to do,Therapist,neutral,Open question
with why you might be struggling with your lines?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Maybe.,Client,neutral,undefined
So how... how did the week go?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Fine.,Client,neutral,undefined
Any lapses?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not really.,Client,neutral,undefined
You left here last week and you were terrified,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that you were going to fail,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
in front of the audience in the theater.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah well, there are still moments when I'm onstage",Client,neutral,undefined
"that I worry about stumbling on this scene or that,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I manage. I get through.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah well, there are still moments when I'm onstage",Client,neutral,undefined
"that I worry about stumbling on this scene or that,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I manage. I get through.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is one of those scenes the one you asked me,Therapist,neutral,Open question
to read with you last week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You were pretty angry when you left.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, I understood why you kicked me out.",Client,neutral,undefined
Kicked you out?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, it was inappropriate. You were not comfortable.",Client,joy,undefined
"Well, that's... that's true.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But the way I remember it,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
you stormed out of the room.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How do you remember that moment?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I asked you to run lines,Client,neutral,undefined
and you refused to help me.,Client,neutral,undefined
I felt sorry for you.,Client,joy,undefined
Really?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, I mean it must be strange,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, treating someone like me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, I mean it must be strange,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, treating someone like me.",Client,neutral,undefined
You mean somebody famous like you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You know, ultimately it's not that interesting",Client,neutral,undefined
"to read a scene, so...",Client,neutral,undefined
Is that something that you've been feeling...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that your work isn't that interesting?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because you have spoken about it passionately in the past.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah well, there are times.",Client,neutral,undefined
Would you like to talk about one of these times?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, it's just that I would...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'd like to understand what it is,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"that you are experiencing,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
what you're feeling.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I've never done it, so I'm curious.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Well, you know I felt really disconnected",Client,neutral,undefined
all that time in rehearsal.,Client,neutral,undefined
And this week...,Client,depression,undefined
"this week in previews,",Client,depression,undefined
I really felt like I understood,Client,depression,undefined
something new about what I...,Client,depression,undefined
"what she needed, you know, in a moment.",Client,depression,undefined
And it just clicked into place.,Client,depression,undefined
It was...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I was totally in time...",Client,neutral,undefined
Present.,Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe it was just the haircut.,Client,joy,undefined
And this feeling of feeling present...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Was it momentary?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, it lasted till the end.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And it was palpable. I mean,",Client,neutral,undefined
the applause was...,Client,neutral,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Loud.,Client,neutral,undefined
That must have felt good.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Think of where you were.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You were terrified.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You were dreading the week of previews.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Then the play goes on. It's a success.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You make this connection.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You must feel a satisfaction.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
What happens between then and now?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I go home.,Client,joy,undefined
The apartment's dark. The fridge is empty.,Client,joy,undefined
I open a can of soup.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's a nasty hangover...,Client,disgust,undefined
my life.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you want to come to opening night?,Client,joy,undefined
"I have a set of tickets and I was just thinking,",Client,joy,undefined
"you know, why don't you just come?",Client,joy,undefined
Why would you want me there?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know. You sound interested, so...",Client,neutral,undefined
Any other reasons?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You could see that I'm good.,Client,joy,undefined
"Well, I know that.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Why?,Client,neutral,undefined
Because I've seen your films.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Which ones?,Client,neutral,undefined
All of them.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Anyway, you've never seen me onstage, right?",Client,joy,undefined
"No, I ve not seen you onstage.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So there you go. You could come and see what it is that I do.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, is that so strange?",Client,joy,undefined
You just said you wanted to...,Client,joy,undefined
It's not strange at all.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I'm gonna have to say no.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Okay, well,",Client,neutral,undefined
is that because of me or some policy or...?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well yes, it is a kind of policy.",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I think that...,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
I think that it would interfere with the work,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
that we're trying to do here in this room.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
But please don't take that personally.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
"No, that's fine. I understand.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'll sell them on ebay.,Client,neutral,undefined
( Chuckles ),Client,neutral,undefined
You were considering inviting Patricia.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Did you do that?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Have you spoken to Patricia this week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I did what you told me to do.,Client,neutral,undefined
What did I tell you to do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You told me that it wasn't too late to make amends.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I went to her and I apologized.,Client,neutral,undefined
For telling her not to be an actress.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She didn't even know what I was talking about.,Client,neutral,undefined
She hardly remembered being in that play.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, I told her",Client,depression,undefined
that I thought she was wonderful,Client,depression,undefined
and that it was wrong of me to dissuade her.,Client,depression,undefined
"And she said, oh, don't worry about that.",Client,depression,undefined
And then she thanked me.,Client,depression,undefined
"She said, I don't know how you bear all that bullshit.",Client,depression,undefined
She said I saved her.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then... this is this best... she said,",Client,depression,undefined
I'm glad I got to lead a real life.,Client,depression,undefined
A real life... can you believe that?,Client,depression,undefined
It must have been hurtful.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You think? Humiliating.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, I was trying to apologize.",Client,disgust,undefined
And did you tell her that? That it felt painful?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Of course not.,Client,depression,undefined
And can I ask why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"She's sick, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
"She's sick, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I went there to make amends,",Client,neutral,undefined
not pick a fight.,Client,neutral,undefined
I... I... I wajust aware,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you felt guilty.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I thought that talking to Patricia might be helpful.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm sorry it wasn't.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"At least now I know what she thinks of me,",Client,depression,undefined
what she thinks of the life I chose.,Client,joy,undefined
What do you think of the life you chose?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The last time we spoke I had the feeling,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you are very invested,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in the way other people see you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and your sister's judgment has...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's clearly had a big impact,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
on how you view yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Look, you know,",Client,depression,undefined
I understand that tricia wouldn't want my life anyway.,Client,depression,undefined
All my conctions,Client,depression,undefined
"are, you know, fiction.",Client,depression,undefined
Maybe they always have been.,Client,depression,undefined
Do you really believe that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I mean, when you met Russell, you told me",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you had a really deep connection with him.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah well, I think we did at first.",Client,depression,undefined
I just... I always felt like I had to prove myself to Russell.,Client,neutral,undefined
Prove yourself?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, to Russell and his friends...",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, these academics,",Client,neutral,undefined
"shrinks, political scientists.",Client,neutral,undefined
I always thought they were gonna see right through me.,Client,depression,undefined
And what do you think they would see?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That there's no there there.,Client,neutral,undefined
That's what Russell used to say about L.A.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You were afraid that that's how Russell saw you,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and his friends... no there there.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, Russell's shallow actress wife.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Yeah, Russell's shallow actress wife.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, but how the fuck would they know?",Client,disgust,undefined
They've never come to a performance either.,Client,disgust,undefined
Are you upset with me,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
because I said I wouldn't come to your play?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
You invited me to an important event...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Your opening night.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And I thank you for that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But isn't there somebody else you'd like to ask instead?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We talked about tricia. What about izzy?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Isn't she someone you'd like to take with you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Have you thought about asking her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, that would require us to be in the same building.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, surely you know",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that the relationship with izzy,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
will survive this teenage angst.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm not sure about that.,Client,depression,undefined
"I know it may not feel that way, but...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You know, sometimes I think that having a teenager",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is like going to the dark side of the moon.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The person that you know and that you love just disappears.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you just have to trust that eventually,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
they will come back.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Maybe different, but they will come back.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did that happen to you?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, with my daughter, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Yeah.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah well, I'm still reading my daughter's emails, so...",Client,joy,undefined
( Chuckles ),Client,joy,undefined
"I don't know. It's an addiction, you know?",Client,joy,undefined
Like a junkie just waiting,Client,joy,undefined
for hits of information about my own kid.,Client,joy,undefined
"You know, she signs some of them Isabel now.",Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, when did she become Isabel?",Client,joy,undefined
You might be curious to know,Client,joy,undefined
that her and young Miller have not yet had sex.,Client,joy,undefined
"They talk about it, however, all the time.",Client,joy,undefined
"I kind of want to tell her,",Client,neutral,undefined
try to preserve some of the mystery.,Client,neutral,undefined
But I want to tell her a lot of things.,Client,neutral,undefined
( Sighs ),Client,neutral,undefined
She did say something nice.,Client,neutral,undefined
Miller had seen a movie of mine on tv,Client,neutral,undefined
"and he said, your mother was amazing.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And izzy wrote back, she is amazing.",Client,joy,undefined
Were you surprised by that comment?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, it was a silly movie. I got good enough revws,",Client,joy,undefined
but it wasn't my best work.,Client,joy,undefined
"What I meant was, were you surprised",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that izzy would compliment you like that?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She wasn't speaking of me.,Client,neutral,undefined
She was speaking of the performance.,Client,neutral,undefined
Izzy revealed how she felt in that email.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She said something very kind about you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She said you were amazing.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
But you dismissed her comment.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I've noticed that again and again,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you put yourself down,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
with remarkable consistency.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And the more success you have,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"the more applause you get for playing other people,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the more convinced you are,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you have nothing to offer as yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
When I said before that I didn't have anyone,Client,depression,undefined
to be there for me at the opening...,Client,depression,undefined
I think what I mean is that I'd really like,Client,joy,undefined
for my mother to be able to be there.,Client,joy,undefined
"You know, I've done a lot of movies since mother died,",Client,depression,undefined
but this will be the first time,Client,depression,undefined
that I'll be onstage without her watching.,Client,depression,undefined
"You really do miss her, don't you?",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Well, it was really like a special light",Client,sadness,undefined
that shone just on me,Client,sadness,undefined
when she was in the audience.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I mean, she came to everything",Client,neutral,undefined
even when I was a kid.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And then when I moved to New York, she used to take the train up.",Client,neutral,undefined
And I flew her to London for the weekend.,Client,joy,undefined
She sat through all four performances.,Client,joy,undefined
That's nine hours of Beckett.,Client,joy,undefined
"Well, that's love.",Therapist,joy,Communication Skills
Even at the very end... I had a premiere here in town.,Client,joy,undefined
And she just didn't want to miss it.,Client,joy,undefined
"She was so sick by then, she was in and out of the hospital.",Client,joy,undefined
But she insisted.,Client,joy,undefined
And tricia had to bring her.,Client,joy,undefined
I remember she wore this amazing blue gown.,Client,joy,undefined
"It had this, like, plunging neckline.",Client,joy,undefined
"And she wore, of course, her red lipstick",Client,joy,undefined
and a black wig with this classic updo.,Client,joy,undefined
She handled herself beautifully.,Client,joy,undefined
She charmed the hell out of everyone.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, it was hard to believe she was sick,",Client,neutral,undefined
let alone dying.,Client,neutral,undefined
We went back to the hotel afterwards.,Client,joy,undefined
I'd gotten this great room with a view of the park and...,Client,joy,undefined
( Exhales ) Ordered champagne...,Client,joy,undefined
Just a great time.,Client,joy,undefined
It was...,Client,depression,undefined
It was the last time I saw her.,Client,depression,undefined
But you told me,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that you were going back and forth,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to the hospital a lot.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I know that's what I said,",Client,sadness,undefined
because honestly that's what it felt like inside.,Client,sadness,undefined
I've been telling myself that story for so long...,Client,sadness,undefined
That you've convinced yourself that it's true.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I mean, when she came to New York, she looked so much better.",Client,sadness,undefined
I thought...,Client,sadness,undefined
I don't know what I thought.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Well, maybe you wanted to remember her like that.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I hated to see her in that bed.,Client,disgust,undefined
That was not her.,Client,disgust,undefined
You said that you felt out of place at the hospital.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Oh, I was inept.",Client,sadness,undefined
"What do you mean, you were inept?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
She was in pain.,Client,sadness,undefined
"I wanted to help, you know,",Client,sadness,undefined
"so I put on her makeup,",Client,sadness,undefined
'cause that's what I know how to do.,Client,sadness,undefined
And then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The meds would wear off and she would start to scream.,Client,sadness,undefined
I couldn't do anything.,Client,sadness,undefined
Nothing. I... I threw up.,Client,sadness,undefined
I vomited in the sink at the hospital.,Client,sadness,undefined
Tricia said it got even worse after the premiere.,Client,sadness,undefined
"She, I think, blamed me, you know,",Client,sadness,undefined
for pushing her too hard.,Client,sadness,undefined
New York was exhausting.,Client,sadness,undefined
Why did I need her to be,Client,disgust,undefined
at this ridiculous premiere?,Client,disgust,undefined
Did she really say that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"We're back on familiar ground really, aren't we?",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"You think that Patricia blames you,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that she's punishing you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And you blame yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
In the end tricia told me,Client,sadness,undefined
that mom was delirious in the hospital.,Client,sadness,undefined
She was talking,Client,sadness,undefined
"about her daughters, you know...",Client,sadness,undefined
"How much she loved us, her little angels,",Client,sadness,undefined
her sweethearts. That was the word she always used...,Client,joy,undefined
"sweethearts, her best girls.",Client,joy,undefined
"I love you, my daughters,",Client,joy,undefined
"my best girls, my angels.",Client,joy,undefined
She was talking as if both of us were there.,Client,joy,undefined
But...,Client,sadness,undefined
I wasn't there.,Client,sadness,undefined
I wasn't there.,Client,sadness,undefined
I never said goodbye to her.,Client,sadness,undefined
My mother...,Client,sadness,undefined
She just must have been so disappointed by me.,Client,sadness,undefined
But your mother didn't know you weren't there.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She couldn't have been disappointed.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were one of her best girls.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She was your biggest fan.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She was so proud of you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
That feeling of disappointment comes from you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
20 years ago you were afraid,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"you didn't have the strength, the heart",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to see your mother through her death.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You were so afraid, you didn't even let yourself show up.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Now your sister is dying,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and you're terrified again.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Are you afraid,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that what Russell thought of you is true...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"That there's no there there, hmm?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think it's really important,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
that you answer this question on your own:,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"What is, or what isn't there,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
inside... inside you?,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Apart from your mother, your sister, your ex-husband,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"me, nobody in the audience...",Therapist,neutral,Advisement

"Wow, okay.",Client,sadness,undefined
"Oh, Paul, last week when I left",Client,neutral,undefined
there was somebody in the waiting room.,Client,neutral,undefined
I really don't want to see anyone.,Client,neutral,undefined

That hasn't happened to me since my grandparents were alive.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can I ask you who it from?,Therapist,neutral,Open question

It's... it's an allergy.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
I'm sorry. So this...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
This letter.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills

When did it arrive?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
A few days ago.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, I'd love to know what it says.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
He says he married my birth mother.,Client,depression,undefined
That's a bit of a shock.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Uh, yeah, tell me about it.",Client,joy,undefined
He says,Client,joy,undefined
"they got pregnant with me when they were, like, 17.",Client,joy,undefined
17,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
They split up for a while,Client,depression,undefined
and then they got back together after college,Client,depression,undefined
and now they're married.,Client,depression,undefined
It says,Client,neutral,undefined
he's writing on her behalf... Karen's.,Client,neutral,undefined

He says she's really depressed right now,Client,neutral,undefined
because I haven't responded to her phone call,Client,neutral,undefined
and it's almost my birthday,Client,neutral,undefined
and she always gets really depressed around my birthday.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, he wants me to write back",Client,neutral,undefined
"and say, like, yes, I'll be in contact with you",Client,neutral,undefined
"or no, go fuck yourselves.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm paraphrasing.,Client,joy,undefined
He says he loves me.,Client,depression,undefined
What a fucking retard.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I think they might be kind of assholes, these people.",Client,depression,undefined
Guess what else?,Client,joy,undefined
I'm getting a b in algebra.,Client,joy,undefined
A b? That's... that's great.,Client,joy,undefined
A b is a fucking miracle.,Client,joy,undefined
We have to take these multiple-choice tests,Client,joy,undefined
because my teacher Mr. Nelson,Client,joy,undefined
"is, like, too lazy to grade a fucking...",Client,joy,undefined
"anyway, it doesn't matter. The point is,",Client,neutral,undefined
he puts the answer sheets through these machines,Client,neutral,undefined
and they come out the other end.,Client,neutral,undefined
Usually if there are a lot of mistakes it takes a really long time,Client,neutral,undefined
and the machine makes all these beeping noises.,Client,neutral,undefined
Mine just kind of zipped out the other end.,Client,joy,undefined
Mr. Nelson looked shocked.,Client,joy,undefined
Did you study for this test?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, why?",Client,neutral,undefined
Then not such a miracle really.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Roberto helped me.,Client,neutral,undefined
Roberto helped me.,Client,neutral,undefined
He helped you study?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
So you must have told him about being suspended.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What? Oh yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
And how did he take that?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was no big deal.,Client,neutral,undefined
Last week you seemed really nervous about telling him.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You were afraid that he might become violent.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"That was a joke. Jesus, why am I the only one",Client,joy,undefined
with a sense of humor around here?,Client,joy,undefined
"Okay, but I still think that you were nervous about how he would react.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Fine. I was, I guess.",Client,neutral,undefined
But he was cool.,Client,joy,undefined
He can be cool.,Client,joy,undefined
Did you talk to him about what happened at the Whitney?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yup.,Client,neutral,undefined
And about Nate?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I told him that Nate kicked the shit out of me, yes.",Client,neutral,undefined
And did you tell him why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
'Cause I'm gay.,Client,neutral,undefined
Did you tell him that you and Nate were...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"that Nate was, um...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
did you tell him that Nate was fellating you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What? Um...,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you have a merriam-Webster dictionary around here?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm sorry, I just... I don't know what that word means.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh, come on, Jesse. You know very well what the word means.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, Paul, I did not tell my father that Nate was sucking my dick.",Client,disgust,undefined
"No, Paul, I did not tell my father that Nate was sucking my dick.",Client,disgust,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why would I?,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you think he wants to know?,Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, would you want to know if your kid...",Client,disgust,undefined
you had no problem telling your mother.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That's different.,Client,neutral,undefined
And why is that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can't you just leave it alone?,Client,neutral,undefined
Can't it just be a nice thing,Client,neutral,undefined
that my dad helped me study and I got a b?,Client,neutral,undefined
"It is a nice thing, Jesse. Yes.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"He's really good at math, my dad.",Client,neutral,undefined
He must have been proud of that b.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah. I mean, he would have rather it was an a,",Client,neutral,undefined
but sure.,Client,neutral,undefined
So can we go back,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
to your birth father's letter for a moment?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
If you want.,Client,neutral,undefined
So... so what's his name?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Um, Kevin.",Client,joy,undefined
Kevin and Karen.,Client,disgust,undefined
"God, that's pathetic, right?",Client,disgust,undefined
Last week you told Marisa that you were gonna live with Karen.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
This week your attitude towards her seems to have changed.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I just think it's really inappropriate of him to contact me.,Client,depression,undefined
Inappropriate?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah. I mean, what the fuck?",Client,disgust,undefined
"I'm a minor, for Christ's sake.",Client,disgust,undefined
What they're doing is illegal.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, they gave me up.",Client,disgust,undefined
They didn't want me.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And, like, now that somebody else has raised me",Client,disgust,undefined
"for 17 years and, like, fed me and clothed me",Client,disgust,undefined
and kept me alive and everything...,Client,disgust,undefined
now suddenly they want back in?,Client,disgust,undefined
"No, sorry. That is not how it works.",Client,disgust,undefined
And how do you think it works?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
People have one set of parents. One.,Client,disgust,undefined
Not two. And I've already got mine.,Client,disgust,undefined
But do you think Karen and Kevin really want to be your parents?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Isn't it possible that they might be looking,Therapist,neutral,Open question
for some other kind of relationship?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like what?,Client,disgust,undefined
Like friendship.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe they just want to get to know you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do your parents know that you got a letter from Kevin?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I wrote a response.,Client,neutral,undefined
I wrote a response.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you want to hear it?,Client,neutral,undefined
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Dear Kevin,",Client,depression,undefined
thank you for contacting me regarding my origins.,Client,depression,undefined
I apologize for causing Karen pain,Client,depression,undefined
and I understand your request.,Client,depression,undefined
"However, I think you should know",Client,depression,undefined
that Karen's call caused significant distress,Client,depression,undefined
to my adoptive parents,Client,depression,undefined
who have taken the trouble to care for me,Client,depression,undefined
for the last 17 years.,Client,depression,undefined
I hope therefore that you understand that at the present time,Client,depression,undefined
I do not wish to be in contact with you.,Client,depression,undefined
I respectfully request that you do not reinitiate contact,Client,depression,undefined
with my current place of residence out of respect for its inhabitants.,Client,depression,undefined
"Sincerely, Jesse Saul D'amato.",Client,depression,undefined
I took an Adderall to write it.,Client,depression,undefined
I think it came out pretty well.,Client,depression,undefined
Thank you for reading it to me.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"It's, um...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It's pretty formal.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah, but I mean, why not, right?",Client,joy,undefined
I'm smart and they should know that.,Client,joy,undefined
Do you want them to know that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"It's a fact, right?",Client,disgust,undefined
"What, you don't think I'm smart?",Client,disgust,undefined
"I didn't say that, Jesse.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
So you don't like the letter?,Client,anger,undefined
"When you came in today,",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I asked you how the past week had been,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
and you said it was weird.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Yeah, so?",Client,depression,undefined
"So apart from this letter arriving,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
did anything else happen during the week,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that was weird?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know, man.",Client,depression,undefined
Marisa.,Client,depression,undefined
Marisa was fucking weird.,Client,depression,undefined
What do you think I mean?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"What, she turned green? She was speaking in tongues?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, she won't get out of bed, okay?",Client,depression,undefined
Is that weird enough for you?,Client,depression,undefined
"Okay, I can see why you would think that was weird.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
And then when I asked her if everything was okay,Client,depression,undefined
she just told me she was sick,Client,depression,undefined
and asked me to close the door.,Client,depression,undefined
You don't think she's sick though.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't know. I don't know what's the matter with her.,Client,depression,undefined
And you haven't spoken at all about Karen's phone call?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No. It's like the whole conversation never happened.,Client,depression,undefined
You said in the letter that Karen's phone call,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
caused significant distress to your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yup.,Client,depression,undefined
Your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Marisa told Roberto.,Client,neutral,undefined
He blew a gasket.,Client,joy,undefined
He said it was totally inappropriate,Client,joy,undefined
of them to do something like that.,Client,joy,undefined
He said it was probably illegal.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, he said he was gonna call the cops.",Client,joy,undefined
"He didn't, but...",Client,joy,undefined
"God, I have never seen him that mad.",Client,neutral,undefined
He's really not an angry guy.,Client,neutral,undefined
I was kidding about all that stuff I said last week.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, he's Italian, you know,",Client,neutral,undefined
so he obviously has a temper.,Client,neutral,undefined
But it takes a lot to set him off.,Client,neutral,undefined
I used to try when I was a kid.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know. Just to, like, see where his breaking point was.",Client,neutral,undefined
You said earlier on that you were a lot closer to your father,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That he became more distant.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, but I mean, I understand.",Client,depression,undefined
He was building his business.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, my grandfather was dying.",Client,depression,undefined
He had to start taking more jobs out of town.,Client,depression,undefined
Sounds like you've missed him.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"This sudden display of emotion, him getting angry",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
when he heard about Karen's call...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I mean, that must have felt...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What?,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, why don't you tell me?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
It felt... Fucking awesome.,Client,disgust,undefined
Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because he gave a fucking shit.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you think it's possible then that his reaction,Therapist,neutral,Open question
has influenced your response to Kevin's letter?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,depression,undefined
No?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What part of that word don't you understand?,Client,depression,undefined
"Look, Jesse, you realized that Karen's phone call",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
was causing your mother and your father pain.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So it's understandable if you felt responsible...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't.,Client,anger,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Look, they raised me.",Client,anger,undefined
They wiped my ass. They taught me to read.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean, they changed my sheets every time I wet the bed,",Client,anger,undefined
"which I did until I was 10, by the way.",Client,anger,undefined
So it is completely ridiculous for these people...,Client,anger,undefined
strangers... to think that they can just waltz back into my life,Client,anger,undefined
after they gave me up for dead and have a relationship with me.,Client,anger,undefined
Relationships have to be earnt.,Client,anger,undefined
That is true.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I know.,Client,anger,undefined
Gave you up for dead?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's a figure of fucking speech.,Client,disgust,undefined
Is it your figure of speech?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you feel that you were difficult to raise?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Come on, man.",Client,joy,undefined
Is that a yes?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I have a.D.D. And I'm a slut.,Client,disgust,undefined
I have a.D.D. And I'm a slut.,Client,disgust,undefined
Would you have wanted a kid like me?,Client,disgust,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Well...,Client,depression,undefined
Give your son another year or two,Client,depression,undefined
and maybe you'll get your wish.,Client,depression,undefined
So how did your father react to Kevin's letter?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Jesse?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He didn't.,Client,depression,undefined
He didn't have any reaction?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No. I didn't tell him.,Client,depression,undefined
Why didn't you tell him?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I just didn't feel like it.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, he got so angry about Karen's phone call.",Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, it's not really any of his business anyway.",Client,disgust,undefined
"What is it, Jesse?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing.,Client,depression,undefined
Why are you shaking your head?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
You must be feeling,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
an incredible amount of pressure right now.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How is the static?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"It's fucking loud, man.",Client,disgust,undefined
I think he's left-handed like me.,Client,depression,undefined
Kevin?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
"There's smudge marks on his letter,",Client,depression,undefined
like what happens to me when I write.,Client,depression,undefined
Look.,Client,depression,undefined
"And, um...",Client,depression,undefined
Here's mine.,Client,depression,undefined
Fuck.,Client,disgust,undefined
They do...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
they do kind of look alike.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Fuck!,Client,anger,undefined
What am I supposed to do with that information?,Client,anger,undefined
"Oh, let me guess. You want me to tell you.",Client,anger,undefined
"Yes, I would. It's a unique experience, Jesse.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Not many people have gone through this.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I want to know how it feels.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"So yes, I would like you to tell me.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Do you think he looks, like, exactly like me?",Client,neutral,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"But he's probably pretty similar looking, right?",Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe you look more like Karen.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Karen.,Client,neutral,undefined
Jesus.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think there's a part of you that's still interested,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in a private relationship with Kevin and Karen,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
independent of your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
In- I think that worries you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Wi- why would it worry me?,Client,depression,undefined
Because I just think that ever since your father,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
found out about Karen's phone call he's been,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
paying much more attention to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"He got angry,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but his anger seems to have comforted you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It seems that this reaction is what you've been looking for since you were a kid.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because to you it's a sign that he cares.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it might seem right now that the way to gain,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and keep his love is to just reject Kevin and Karen.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And the way to lose his love perhaps,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
is to reach out to them.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You know that little theory you had last week?,Client,depression,undefined
The one where Marisa gave up on catholicism,Client,depression,undefined
because the church didn't support my sexual identity?,Client,depression,undefined
It's horseshit.,Client,depression,undefined
"Yeah, I went into her room today",Client,depression,undefined
to see if she needed anything,Client,depression,undefined
because she hasn't left the bed in a week.,Client,depression,undefined
She wasn't in there but the closet door was a little open.,Client,depression,undefined
And she was in there,Client,depression,undefined
on her knees praying.,Client,depression,undefined
God.,Client,joy,undefined
Can you believe it?,Client,joy,undefined
In the fucking closet.,Client,disgust,undefined
I come out and she goes in.,Client,depression,undefined
Why do you think she's doing that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I guess she doesn't want me to interrupt,Client,depression,undefined
her little tete-a-tete with Jesus.,Client,depression,undefined
I think your mother is really scared right now.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What the hell does she have to be scared of?,Client,depression,undefined
Losing you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe she feels you're slipping away from her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And it's possible that she might be turning to religion,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"to her relationship with God,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because that provides her with some kind of comfort,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and a sense of control.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She doesn't want you to see her praying,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because she's afraid you'll think she's choosing,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the church over you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I can't believe they married each other.,Client,neutral,undefined
Yeah.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I can't believe I have a whole other set,Client,joy,undefined
of parents out there somewhere.,Client,joy,undefined
What do you think their house is like?,Client,joy,undefined
I don't know.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Anyway, I think that we should...",Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
we should talk about it next week.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Let's both think about how you want to respond,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"to your birth parent's letter,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
if that's what you decide to do.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know,",Client,neutral,undefined
I kind of feel like it's all gonna be okay for some reason.,Client,neutral,undefined
I don't know why.,Client,neutral,undefined
Good.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Oh wait... your letters.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Um, will you keep them for me?",Client,neutral,undefined
Sometimes Marisa goes through my bag.,Client,neutral,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Thanks.,Client,neutral,undefined
What she told you was hard to hear.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Of course it was.,Client,depression,undefined
All this time going on and telling you about,Client,anger,undefined
"how traumatized my son was by his stepfather,",Client,anger,undefined
and turns out he's in love with the guy.,Client,anger,undefined
He's in love with...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"it's a figure of speech,",Client,anger,undefined
but it's basically what Rosie told me,Client,anger,undefined
in so many words.,Client,anger,undefined
"I mean,",Client,anger,undefined
Max and Steve spent the whole weekend together,Client,anger,undefined
going to museums. They draw together. They...,Client,anger,undefined
"Steve brings him into the architecture studio, teaches him...",Client,anger,undefined
I don't even know the terms...,Client,anger,undefined
"line drawing, drafting, whatever it's called,",Client,anger,undefined
how to use a mechanical pencil.,Client,anger,undefined
Have you spoken to Max about this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I haven't spoken with Max about much of anything.,Client,depression,undefined
I was gonna sit him down,Client,depression,undefined
as soon as he came back from Maryland,Client,depression,undefined
and talk to him about what he found,Client,depression,undefined
on my computer that night...,Client,depression,undefined
"you know, my Parkinson's research.",Client,depression,undefined
"But since my conversation with Rosie,",Client,depression,undefined
I haven't been able to bring myself to do it.,Client,depression,undefined
What are you afraid to hear Max say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Are you...,Client,neutral,undefined
are you really gonna make me answer that?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, you... you saw perfectly",Client,neutral,undefined
what was happening last week,Client,neutral,undefined
more clearly than I saw it myself.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sure you know the answer without me having to say it.,Client,neutral,undefined
You think I know what you're going to say before you say it?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was getting my son to worry about me.,Client,fear,undefined
He won't tell me about Steve,Client,fear,undefined
because he's trying to protect me.,Client,fear,undefined
I...,Client,fear,undefined
I can't stop myself from wondering,Client,fear,undefined
"if, you know...",Client,fear,undefined
if he'd actually be better off in Maryland.,Client,fear,undefined
With his mother and Steve.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It's hard for you to consider that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"They share this passion for drawing, for art.",Client,fear,undefined
"And Steve feeds it. I mean, how can I deny my son that?",Client,fear,undefined
"If I did, I'd be doing exactly what was done to me.",Client,fear,undefined
I'd be... I'd be dragging him away,Client,fear,undefined
from his vibrant teenage years,Client,fear,undefined
"and taking him to a dreary,",Client,fear,undefined
lifeless apartment with a sick parent.,Client,fear,undefined
Is that how you see your existence...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
as dreary and lifeless?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm sure that's how Max sees it.,Client,depression,undefined
I wasn't asking about Max.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I really wish Rosie had never told me,Client,disgust,undefined
about the fucking twin drafting tables.,Client,disgust,undefined
I really could have done without that detail.,Client,disgust,undefined
Is that what gets to you most?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It all gets to me... the whole picture.,Client,disgust,undefined
And it's not just them either.,Client,disgust,undefined
Just about everybody I know has some kind of passion.,Client,disgust,undefined
Something or somebody drives them.,Client,disgust,undefined
But not you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Sometimes I...,Client,disgust,undefined
"I try to pretend I do, yeah.",Client,disgust,undefined
"I try to pretend I do, yeah.",Client,disgust,undefined
How do you do that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"What does that mean, you pretend?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Wendy...,Client,neutral,undefined
"uh, my girlfriend...",Client,neutral,undefined
she stopped by the apartment,Client,neutral,undefined
at lunchtime today.,Client,neutral,undefined
And she knows I have an hour and a half,Client,neutral,undefined
without any patients. And...,Client,neutral,undefined
We... we haven't had sex for a while.,Client,neutral,undefined
And...,Client,neutral,undefined
Since she can't stay over,Client,neutral,undefined
and I can't stay at her place because of Max...,Client,neutral,undefined
Max was away this weekend.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Right. That's true. I hadn't told her that.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you saw her today.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"She has this thing, you know... she...",Client,neutral,undefined
for some reason she's been wanting,Client,neutral,undefined
to have sex on the couch in my office.,Client,neutral,undefined
So we did.,Client,neutral,undefined
This was your attempt at being passionate about something.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I suppose you're right.,Client,neutral,undefined
And?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I was...,Client,depression,undefined
I was distracted. I was...,Client,depression,undefined
I was...,Client,depression,undefined
I was thinking about other things.,Client,depression,undefined
What were you thinking about?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
Not her.,Client,depression,undefined
I have this... I have this boat in my office.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I just found myself staring...,Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, staring at it",Client,neutral,undefined
after Wendy and I were finished.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It's a... a model, a sailboat.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's about that big.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I used to have about 26 of them,",Client,neutral,undefined
"different sizes, you know, schooners, sloops.",Client,neutral,undefined
Do you like to sail?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Never been.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, these... these boats are...",Client,neutral,undefined
"actually, the boats are the closest I've ever come to a hobby.",Client,neutral,undefined
"And when Max was little,",Client,joy,undefined
he really loved it.,Client,joy,undefined
We used to go searching at these antique stores.,Client,joy,undefined
"Sometimes we'd build them from kits, you know.",Client,joy,undefined
And we'd give them each a name,Client,joy,undefined
and we'd make up these stories,Client,joy,undefined
about the places it had been,Client,joy,undefined
and the places that it would go.,Client,joy,undefined
How come there's only one boat left?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He lost interest.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Then when I moved up to Brooklyn,",Client,neutral,undefined
I just left the rest of them behind.,Client,neutral,undefined
"They... I don't know,",Client,joy,undefined
they just started to feel a bit pathetic...,Client,joy,undefined
22 reminders,Client,joy,undefined
of all the places I'd never been and I would never get to.,Client,joy,undefined
The one that I saved... I keep it in my office.,Client,neutral,undefined
I see it over my patients' shoulders.,Client,neutral,undefined
"So I sit and I listen to them talk,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and every single one of them, they...",Client,neutral,undefined
no matter how sick or screwed up they are...,Client,neutral,undefined
they... they all have a real passion.,Client,neutral,undefined
You find all your patients,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"have something you don't, something you're missing?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I do feel that way a lot, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined
Jesse... he loves photography.,Client,neutral,undefined
He's got this fierce attachment to his camera.,Client,neutral,undefined
And frances has her acting.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Although it's hard for her to admit, with all the guilt she has around it,",Client,neutral,undefined
there's no question of what it means to her.,Client,neutral,undefined
Other people...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Kate devoted to her clinic,",Client,neutral,undefined
now to Max's new father.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, even Gina... suddenly a novelist.",Client,disgust,undefined
"As much as I fucking hate her for what she's written,",Client,disgust,undefined
she has found her...,Client,disgust,undefined
"you know, her calling.",Client,disgust,undefined
And there's... there's you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Me?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Why do you include me?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What do you consider my passion to be?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, isn't it this...",Client,neutral,undefined
"your work, your patients?",Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, not that there aren't other things",Client,neutral,undefined
"that you might feel strongly about,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but from where I sit, you seem to be",Client,neutral,undefined
pretty engaged,Client,neutral,undefined
even in your cool detachment.,Client,neutral,undefined
Am I engaged or detached?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'd... I'd say both.,Client,neutral,undefined
But... but it is clear,Client,neutral,undefined
that your work is very important to you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Am I wrong about that?,Client,neutral,undefined
My work is important to me.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"I'm just wondering why you say that,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
how you arrive at this impression.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I went online, you know, the other night.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's become kind of a bad habit really.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I found myself back at my desk,",Client,depression,undefined
typing in this thing,Client,depression,undefined
on Parkinson's/ olfactory symptoms.,Client,depression,undefined
And I...,Client,depression,undefined
I just stopped. I made myself stop.,Client,depression,undefined
And I...,Client,depression,undefined
I just happened to type in your name instead.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Did you know there's another Adele Brouse,",Client,neutral,undefined
"also a therapist, in Portland, Oregon?",Client,neutral,undefined
I wasn't aware of that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Yeah, an m.S.W., not a psychiatrist,",Client,neutral,undefined
not nearly as prolific as you.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, all this... a list of stuff comes up,",Client,neutral,undefined
"all the articles that you've published over, you know...",Client,neutral,undefined
the amount of conferences that you've attended,Client,neutral,undefined
"in Chicago,",Client,neutral,undefined
"Prague, Paris.",Client,neutral,undefined
What did seeing that mean to you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, the last article that I wrote was in 1998.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why have you stopped?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Adele Saskia Brouse.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that Dutch?,Client,neutral,undefined
Wasn't Rembrandt's wife called Saskia?,Client,neutral,undefined
My mother's father was from Holland.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I don't believe it.,Client,joy,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You just... you answered my question.,Client,joy,undefined
You still haven't answered mine.,Therapist,joy,Interpretation
Why have you stopped?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, let's say that I...",Client,depression,undefined
that I no longer share,Client,depression,undefined
your professional drive.,Client,depression,undefined
My work does feel meaningful at times.,Client,depression,undefined
"When I'm in the room with my patients,",Client,depression,undefined
"I'm still interested mostly,",Client,depression,undefined
but am I passionate?,Client,depression,undefined
You mean in the way you think I am.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Were you ever?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"When I was your age, I published.",Client,joy,undefined
I still thought I could save people.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you ever think that now?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Monday, for 40 minutes,",Client,neutral,undefined
I had a flash of that feeling.,Client,neutral,undefined
What happened monday?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You remember Sunil. I told you about him.,Client,neutral,undefined
He took... he took a huge step.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'd been trying to get him,Client,neutral,undefined
to express his anger.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he'd been inching toward it.,Client,neutral,undefined
So we were sitting in my office over tea and we were talk...,Client,neutral,undefined
you were talking over tea?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It makes him feel,Client,neutral,undefined
like we're having more of a conversation than therapy.,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, he's a guy who spends all his time",Client,neutral,undefined
feeling like an outsider in what he perceives to be,Client,neutral,undefined
"this strange, aggressive country.",Client,neutral,undefined
So he locks himself away in his room.,Client,neutral,undefined
So sharing tea with me makes him...,Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, draws him out of his shell.",Client,neutral,undefined
Are you talking about him or you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm talking about him.,Client,neutral,undefined
Last week you told me that you didn't want,Client,neutral,undefined
to be my supervisor.,Client,neutral,undefined
Now you kind of sit there,Client,neutral,undefined
silently supervising.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's kind of obvious what you think.,Client,neutral,undefined
What do I think?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He opened up to me.,Client,neutral,undefined
He... he told me about,Client,neutral,undefined
this deeply passionate affair that he had at university...,Client,neutral,undefined
something he's never spoken of before to anybody,Client,neutral,undefined
and that's haunted him for years.,Client,neutral,undefined
You should have seen how transformed he was,Client,neutral,undefined
when he spoke about this love affair.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's like he...,Client,neutral,undefined
he came alive.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, this man isn't... he's not old.",Client,neutral,undefined
He felt passion at one point in his life.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I thought, why couldn't he have that again?",Client,neutral,undefined
Why couldn't he... ?,Client,neutral,undefined
Why couldn't he...?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I don't know. It was...,Client,neutral,undefined
"it was fleeting, what I saw in him,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but a glimpse of somebody different, you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
Maybe I'm making too much of it.,Client,neutral,undefined
This recent session with Sunil,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
had a powerful effect on you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You seem especially focused on his early love affair.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, it's a pretty powerful story, don't you think?",Client,neutral,undefined
Have you ever felt that passion,Therapist,neutral,Open question
romantic passion?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
My lunchtime session with Wendy doesn't qualify?,Client,joy,undefined
Not according to you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"With Kate,",Client,depression,undefined
"I suppose,",Client,depression,undefined
when I fell in love with her all those years ago.,Client,depression,undefined
"Even with Wendy last year, at the very beginning.",Client,neutral,undefined
But now I...,Client,depression,undefined
I'm beginning to realize I've got this pattern:,Client,depression,undefined
I seek out people who have... who have...,Client,depression,undefined
who have themselves a passion for life,Client,depression,undefined
and I feed off them instead.,Client,depression,undefined
I allow them to...,Client,depression,undefined
to feel for both of us.,Client,depression,undefined
You allowed both Wendy and Kate,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to do your feeling for you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, at least... at least in part.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Whatever emotion you do feel,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
do you openly express yourself at the time?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Not entirely.,Client,depression,undefined
You hold yourself back?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Is... is that what you think?,Client,depression,undefined
"Earlier, when you were talking about Sunil,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"you became engaged, excited,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
as you came alive yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You spoke with energy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You sat forward in your seat.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And then you stopped yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was striking.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Does that description seem accurate to you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you find you have,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"passionate or excited impulses,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
but stop yourself from expressing them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I made a similar observation a couple of weeks ago,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"about you holding yourself back,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and you had a strong reaction. Do you remember?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
What... what are you talking about?,Client,depression,undefined
You told me about the beginning of your dream...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"running toward open gates along a wrought-iron fence,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"and then being dragged down, paralyzed.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I asked if you were stopping yourself,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and you got very angry at me.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You insisted it was your father who was stopping you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It was my school.,Client,depression,undefined
It was my school.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm sorry?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
It was my school.,Client,depression,undefined
The fence... the iron fence,Client,depression,undefined
ran around the outside of the boarding school I went to.,Client,depression,undefined
When was this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I... I was 12.,Client,depression,undefined
You were Max's age.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
Lancaster royal grammar school,Client,depression,undefined
in the north of england.,Client,depression,undefined
"I wasn't there for very long, just a term and a half, but...",Client,depression,undefined
"well, my parents had already started",Client,disgust,undefined
to fight with each other.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And yeah, it was our last year in dublin.",Client,disgust,undefined
And they sent me away to school.,Client,disgust,undefined
Was that hard for you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, not at all.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Most people talk about how miserable they are at boarding school,",Client,neutral,undefined
but I was really happy there.,Client,joy,undefined
But I was there for less than six months,Client,neutral,undefined
when my father got his position,Client,neutral,undefined
at union memorial in Baltimore.,Client,neutral,undefined
Two weeks later we landed in...,Client,depression,undefined
in America.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, I'm...",Client,depression,undefined
I'm sure that's part of the dream,Client,depression,undefined
"that I'm, you know, reliving...",Client,depression,undefined
"being torn away from school by my father,",Client,disgust,undefined
from that feeling that I had...,Client,disgust,undefined
that great feeling,Client,depression,undefined
of contentment that I'd found there.,Client,depression,undefined
Can you tell me what was so nice about the boarding school?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The place was...,Client,neutral,undefined
was just filled with activity.,Client,neutral,undefined
There were scores of clubs,Client,neutral,undefined
"and things that you could do,",Client,neutral,undefined
teams you could sign up for...,Client,neutral,undefined
"to play rugby,",Client,neutral,undefined
"cross-country running, the school newspaper.",Client,neutral,undefined
It's just all these things,Client,disgust,undefined
my father tore me away from.,Client,disgust,undefined
Cross-country running... did you run at school?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, I was going to join the team.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Did you play rugby, join the paper?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, I was planning to.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not sure what you're getting at.,Client,neutral,undefined
The point I'm making is that I was happy there.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Actively engaged, content.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"It's interesting to hear you speak of the school in this way,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
because in your dream you're running outside the gates.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"When you told me the dream, you described a feeling",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"of anticipation, of excitement,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
not of contentment.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To me that difference seems significant.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You say you planned to join the newspaper?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Well, I hadn't been there that long.",Client,neutral,undefined
A semester and a half?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Surely that's enough time,Therapist,neutral,Approval
to join the paper if you'd wanted to.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, I'm just saying that if I had stayed,",Client,neutral,undefined
I would have thrived.,Client,neutral,undefined
It was my father moving here,Client,disgust,undefined
that just took away that possibility.,Client,disgust,undefined
And what did you find here instead?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The move to Baltimore marked the end of my childhood.,Client,disgust,undefined
My father walked out; My mother got sicker;,Client,disgust,undefined
And I was... I was forced to...,Client,disgust,undefined
to take care of her.,Client,disgust,undefined
The beginning of a very difficult period.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And your father bears a great deal of the responsibility.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, who else?",Client,depression,undefined
My mother... she was... she was ill.,Client,depression,undefined
I understand.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You mentioned more than once,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"how strongly you identify with Sunil's alienation in this country,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that you continue to feel it at times.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
And I imagine you felt it when you first arrived.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yes, I...",Client,depression,undefined
I went from Lancaster royal grammar,Client,depression,undefined
"to p.S. 233,",Client,depression,undefined
from beautiful gothic stone buildings,Client,depression,undefined
and open green fields,Client,depression,undefined
to brick and asphalt.,Client,depression,undefined
That's tough for rugby.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
The kids played stickball.,Client,depression,undefined
And I remember watching them,Client,depression,undefined
with such determination,Client,depression,undefined
from the edge of the schoolyard.,Client,depression,undefined
Determination? What does that mean?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was...,Client,neutral,undefined
"I was determined to decode them,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, to figure them out...",Client,disgust,undefined
"how to play their game, how to fit in.",Client,disgust,undefined
Because everything about them was alien...,Client,disgust,undefined
"the music that they listened to,",Client,disgust,undefined
"the clothes that they wore, even their curse words.",Client,disgust,undefined
And the girls... the girls...,Client,depression,undefined
forget it.,Client,depression,undefined
They wouldn't even look in my direction.,Client,depression,undefined
"You stayed on the edge of that schoolyard as well,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
outside the gates.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was trying to join in. I was trying to find my way.,Client,disgust,undefined
And I just... I just didn't get a chance to.,Client,disgust,undefined
You were pulled away again.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Mm-hmm, yeah.",Client,depression,undefined
How long was your family in America,Therapist,neutral,Open question
before your father walked out?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
18 months.,Client,depression,undefined
A year and a half.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Oh okay, I get the point you're trying to make...",Client,joy,undefined
"that I had time, like at boarding school,",Client,depression,undefined
to join in.,Client,depression,undefined
"But see, the thing is, my father was...",Client,depression,undefined
he was working really long hours.,Client,depression,undefined
And my mother was already unwell.,Client,depression,undefined
You were expected to stay home with her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yes, I was. And I did.",Client,depression,undefined
Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
It was a terrible blow.,Client,depression,undefined
Was it?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What do you mean?,Client,depression,undefined
Was it a terrible blow or was it also a relief?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was trying to be a good son.,Client,neutral,undefined
I understand it.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Is that so awful?,Client,neutral,undefined
Of course it's not awful.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
What I'm saying is that it may have been easier than the alternative.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think I wanted to spend my teenage years,Client,depression,undefined
with my chronically ill mother?,Client,depression,undefined
I mean...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"The first day I met you, you insisted",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"that you and Gina had it all figured out,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that your need to save people,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
started with your mother's illness.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And does that seem far-fetched to you?,Client,depression,undefined
It doesn't.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But I think caring for your mother,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
was also a way of saving yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"It was miserable, yes,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
but it was also safe,Therapist,neutral,Approval
and familiar.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And it kept you from having to find,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"any real connections elsewhere,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
from risking yourself in the outside world.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it also had the convenience,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
of allowing you to blame it all on your father.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And it's really not so different,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"from what you do to this day, is it?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
You cloister yourself in your apartment,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or your burrow like office.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You convince yourself you're sick.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You accept a growing paralysis,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
rather than taking a risk of finding,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
where or towards whom your real passion lies.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is it any wonder,Therapist,neutral,Open question
you haven't found what drives you yet?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You're 57 years old.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
At a certain point you have to move past,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"the stories that you've assigned to your life,",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
these steadfast explanations,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
you've settled on years ago.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You have to look at yourself again,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
for real answers.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You have to take that risk.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Well...,Client,neutral,undefined
You're so young,Client,neutral,undefined
and yet you're so confident.,Client,neutral,undefined
About what?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You just seem so certain that you're right.,Client,neutral,undefined
You see everything clearly.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think I see you clearly?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Because I'd like to see you more clearly,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but I find you're fairly expert,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
at obscuring the view.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"That's not the first time you've heard that, is it?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
In so many words.,Client,neutral,undefined
I... I told you earlier,Client,depression,undefined
that I was distracted,Client,depression,undefined
when I was with Wendy.,Client,depression,undefined
And you asked me what I was thinking about.,Client,depression,undefined
And I said I didn't know.,Client,depression,undefined
"You asked me if I hold myself back,",Client,depression,undefined
and I didn't answer.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, I do hold myself back.",Client,depression,undefined
Do you know why?,Client,depression,undefined
I was thinking about you.,Client,depression,undefined
I hear your voice,Client,depression,undefined
a lot.,Client,depression,undefined
"I admire your clarity, your...",Client,depression,undefined
you see me.,Client,depression,undefined
I noticed that you don't wear a wedding ring.,Client,depression,undefined
And I've imagined,Client,depression,undefined
"that you might understand something of my life,",Client,depression,undefined
my loneliness.,Client,depression,undefined
"I know, I know...",Client,neutral,undefined
textbook transference.,Client,joy,undefined
"I know it's ridiculous, a fantasy.",Client,neutral,undefined
And it's my comeuppance,Client,neutral,undefined
for being on the receiving end of these sorts of feelings.,Client,neutral,undefined
But you did ask.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm glad you answered.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You look...,Client,neutral,undefined
you look kind of shocked.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why do you say that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Nothing.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you recognize what you're doing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You're holding yourself back again.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"As soon as you express your feelings,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"you dismiss them immediately,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"call it ridiculous, offer an excuse.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What...,Client,depression,undefined
what exactly are you saying?,Client,depression,undefined
I'm saying that between now and next session,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
you may want to think about why you do that.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Are you telling me...?,Client,depression,undefined
Are you trying to say...?,Client,depression,undefined
We have to stop.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Let's pick this up next week.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
This will be an excellent place to start.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
We'll talk more next week.,Therapist,neutral,Structuring the therapy
Have a good weekend.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"You know, I have to admit",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I was a little bit worried the last time,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
at the end of our session.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Things are no better, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
In fact they are worse.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why? Has something... has something happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Monsoons have flooded the region,Client,depression,undefined
where my parents were raised...,Client,depression,undefined
Entire village underwater.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, I... I had no idea.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I'm so sorry to hear that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
How would you have any idea?,Client,depression,undefined
Because floods have scarcely made the news here.,Client,depression,undefined
Everything is about the New York Knicks.,Client,depression,undefined
Who is this player...,Client,neutral,undefined
Amare Stoudemire?,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm searching to hear of the disaster in India,Client,neutral,undefined
and all they want to talk about,Client,neutral,undefined
"is this basketball player,",Client,neutral,undefined
as if he's a superhero,Client,neutral,undefined
and he's going to save the world now.,Client,neutral,undefined
Now I'm all the time searching for news on the b.B.C. Channel,Client,neutral,undefined
or on this radio with this terrible reception.,Client,neutral,undefined
And...,Client,neutral,undefined
These pictures... they stay in my mind.,Client,depression,undefined
And... and I'm having difficulty to sleep.,Client,depression,undefined
"So when you do manage to sleep,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
are you having any more of these disturbing dreams?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I keep seeing the same image...,Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, a boy, perhaps three or four.",Client,neutral,undefined
"You know, a boy, perhaps three or four.",Client,neutral,undefined
"He's clinging to an automobile tire,",Client,fear,undefined
and his head barely above water,Client,fear,undefined
"and his eyes, you know... they are pleading.",Client,fear,undefined
This is in the dream?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No no, this is real. It was on the news... B.B.C. News.",Client,neutral,undefined
I wanted to pass through the television,Client,neutral,undefined
and rescue that poor child.,Client,neutral,undefined
People are traveling from other areas to help.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I'm trapped in Brooklyn,",Client,depression,undefined
"useless, locked away like a prisoner.",Client,depression,undefined
So is that what you feel like...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
like a prisoner in your son's home?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
My son is gone.,Client,depression,undefined
"He's been gone for three days,",Client,depression,undefined
attending a medical conference in St. Louis.,Client,depression,undefined
Before he left we watched the early reports together.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He pointed to the television and said,",Client,neutral,undefined
"oh baba, I'm glad that you are not there.",Client,neutral,undefined
Hmm.,Client,neutral,undefined
I feel like,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm outside of my life.,Client,neutral,undefined
I feel like a... like a stranger.,Client,neutral,undefined
"A prisoner, a stranger.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I cannot stop myself from watching.,Client,neutral,undefined
I cannot change how I feel.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just wonder if there aren't other things,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
that you might be able to change.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"Other things, meaning what?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Look, Sunil,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
things can't go on as they are.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What about the possibility,Therapist,neutral,Open question
of your moving from your son's home?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I know you can't go back to Calcutta... you told me that...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but finding someplace else to live.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And where...,Client,neutral,undefined
"Where, please tell me, would that be?",Client,neutral,undefined
Your own apartment?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Okay.,Client,neutral,undefined
And... and who would pay... pay for this?,Client,neutral,undefined
You could get a job.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Like selling printer cartridges at best buy,Client,neutral,undefined
or standing behind a kebab wagon?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I cannot do that, Paul. I will not.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm not suggesting that you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But you're just wasting your time, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
"See, I'm as helpless to change my surroundings",Client,neutral,undefined
as those people in my country,Client,neutral,undefined
who are unable to save their houses from floodwaters.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I know you are a hopeful man, my friend.",Client,neutral,undefined
You like to think that you can...,Client,neutral,undefined
You can fix everything.,Client,neutral,undefined
I think that you have to talk with your son.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"No, just... just hear me out on this.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You're not happy where you are.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
And it's pretty obvious that having you in their home,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
hasn't been easy for them either.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Yet you've never spoken to your son about this.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You've never expressed to him directly,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
what you feel or what it is exactly that you want.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
( Speaks bengali ),Client,disgust,undefined
I didn't understand that.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
( Speaks bengali ),Client,disgust,undefined
( Sighs ),Client,disgust,undefined
I said,Client,disgust,undefined
that you are wasting my time too.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I know, I know it can be difficult",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"to talk to family,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"your children, in a completely honest way",Therapist,neutral,Approval
because you risk a painful conversation.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"This is just a strategy, yes...",Client,neutral,undefined
to tell me you know how I feel?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No no, it's not a strategy.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Look, Sunil, I have kids myself.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I know what this is like...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
to sometimes want to put off,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
difficult discussions.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"But you don't know my son, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined
You have no idea.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm telling you with certainty,Client,disgust,undefined
there's nothing to be gained...,Client,disgust,undefined
absolutely nothing.,Client,disgust,undefined
You're so convinced that he's not gonna help you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How can you know that for sure?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I've already spoken to him,Client,disgust,undefined
the night before he left.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I was thinking of you, Paul...",Client,depression,undefined
How you encourage me to express myself.,Client,depression,undefined
So I told him the truth.,Client,depression,undefined
I told him that seeing the images made me certain,Client,depression,undefined
and I need to return.,Client,depression,undefined
"Here I'm useless. I'm only in the way here, to let me go.",Client,depression,undefined
And what did he say to that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"He told me that he would never let me go back to Calcutta,",Client,depression,undefined
"he had made a promise,",Client,depression,undefined
and he could never betray his mother.,Client,depression,undefined
He also told me that...,Client,depression,undefined
why do you want to make a fool of yourself?,Client,disgust,undefined
"What will you do back in India,",Client,disgust,undefined
"in all that water, jobless?",Client,disgust,undefined
"Then he said, Julia will send a check",Client,disgust,undefined
"to the red cross in your name,",Client,disgust,undefined
and that they would buy me,Client,depression,undefined
a queen-sized mattress,Client,depression,undefined
from Macy's departmental store.,Client,depression,undefined
Later that night I overheard them,Client,depression,undefined
talking in the kitchen.,Client,depression,undefined
"Julia was saying, oh, if he wants to go, let him go.",Client,depression,undefined
And she said,Client,depression,undefined
she was not comfortable,Client,depression,undefined
staying with me alone in the house.,Client,depression,undefined
And what did Arun say to that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He told Julia that she was being dramatic and ridiculous,Client,depression,undefined
and that he felt better having a man there,Client,depression,undefined
to protect her and the children while he was away.,Client,depression,undefined
Then Julia called me,Client,depression,undefined
"unstable,",Client,depression,undefined
this word unstable...,Client,disgust,undefined
like an old fruit wagon with loose wheels.,Client,disgust,undefined
To be called this word...,Client,disgust,undefined
I held a position,Client,depression,undefined
of mathematics professor for 28 years.,Client,depression,undefined
I was married to Kamala for 30 years.,Client,depression,undefined
Is this a profile of someone,Client,depression,undefined
who is unstable?,Client,depression,undefined
"If anything, she is unstable... Julia.",Client,disgust,undefined
She has been behaving like a madperson...,Client,disgust,undefined
madperson since Arun went away.,Client,disgust,undefined
"How do you mean, she's behaving like a madperson? What is she doing?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
She's continuing her adventures,Client,disgust,undefined
with Mr. Ethan Barr... the pale fox.,Client,disgust,undefined
"On Saturday night they went out,",Client,disgust,undefined
leaving Naya with an upset stomach.,Client,disgust,undefined
And you were watching the children?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No no, I'm not allowed.",Client,disgust,undefined
She would not allow that.,Client,disgust,undefined
Liza the nanny...,Client,neutral,undefined
She stayed late.,Client,neutral,undefined
Uh-huh.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
He actually came up to the door to pick her up.,Client,disgust,undefined
So you met him?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, he is not quite as handsome",Client,disgust,undefined
as he appears on the jacket cover.,Client,disgust,undefined
And did you speak to him? Did he...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We shook hands.,Client,neutral,undefined
"He's young,",Client,neutral,undefined
more modest than I thought.,Client,neutral,undefined
I congratulated him on his success.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then he said something which surprised me.,Client,neutral,undefined
He said that... I have heard,Client,neutral,undefined
quite a lot about you.,Client,neutral,undefined
When they walked down the stairs,Client,depression,undefined
they looked back at me and they laughed.,Client,depression,undefined
You thought they were laughing at you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Please, Paul, you must trust me.",Client,depression,undefined
"If you had seen for yourself,",Client,depression,undefined
you could not doubt me this time... not this time.,Client,depression,undefined
"My son said he wanted me there to protect her,",Client,depression,undefined
but I felt quite the opposite.,Client,depression,undefined
I wished to smother her laughing.,Client,disgust,undefined
To...,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Let me get this straight...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
To smother the sound of her laughter,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or to smother her?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"They were laughing at me, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Yeah, I understand...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, you don't understand. They were humiliating me.",Client,anger,undefined
"See, now look at your face. I have alarmed you now.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Yes actually, because the words that you're using are...",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm trying to share with you,Client,disgust,undefined
how their laughter disturbed me.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I'm trying to express myself, as you say.",Client,disgust,undefined
"You understand this, yes?",Client,disgust,undefined
"I think so, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Good. Because it only grew worse.,Client,disgust,undefined
At 1:00,Client,disgust,undefined
I heard talking in front of the building.,Client,disgust,undefined
My window faces the street.,Client,disgust,undefined
I saw Julia and Ethan barr.,Client,disgust,undefined
He escorted her up the steps,Client,disgust,undefined
and then... and then,Client,disgust,undefined
kissed her goodnight.,Client,disgust,undefined
What do you make of this?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, it depends what kind of a kiss it was.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
A kiss is a kiss.,Client,disgust,undefined
Don't you think I know what a kiss looks like?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, was it on the lips?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No no, it was on the cheek.",Client,disgust,undefined
"Well, that's not really an uncommon thing",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for people in America to do when they're saying goodbye.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I know, I know. You will think what you want to think.",Client,depression,undefined
"Anyway, after he kissed her,",Client,depression,undefined
Julia carefully lifted her hand,Client,depression,undefined
to a spot below his eye,Client,depression,undefined
and then gently drew the back of her curled fingers,Client,depression,undefined
down his cheek.,Client,depression,undefined
Julia never touches my son's face in this manner.,Client,depression,undefined
"How much proof do you need, Paul?",Client,depression,undefined
Last week I brought you solid evidence...,Client,depression,undefined
Her birth control pills... and you still want more.,Client,depression,undefined
Is this not enough?,Client,depression,undefined
Not necessarily.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"It's not acceptable, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
She is disgracing my family.,Client,anger,undefined
"After I witnessed the kiss,",Client,anger,undefined
I could not move from the window.,Client,anger,undefined
I could hear her,Client,anger,undefined
"down on the second floor, preparing her bed.",Client,anger,undefined
And I thought I heard her lock her bedroom door.,Client,anger,undefined
She did not even come upstairs,Client,anger,undefined
to check on Naya.,Client,anger,undefined
"And then I wanted to go to sleep,",Client,anger,undefined
but I could not stop myself thinking of Julia,Client,anger,undefined
"lying on her bed,",Client,anger,undefined
who she was thinking of.,Client,anger,undefined
I think it all would be better,Client,anger,undefined
if she ran off with Mr. pale fox,Client,anger,undefined
or she simply disappears.,Client,anger,undefined
Disappears? What do you...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What do you mean by that... disappears?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I have to say that some of the words,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"that you've used today, Sunil...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I really want to understand,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
what it is that you are trying to say to me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
If your feelings are as extreme,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
as I'm hearing them today...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You asked me whether I had,Client,depression,undefined
more disturbing dreams.,Client,depression,undefined
You asked me whether I had,Client,depression,undefined
more disturbing dreams.,Client,depression,undefined
I have had one again.,Client,depression,undefined
The same one?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, a different one.",Client,disgust,undefined
It was quite troubling.,Client,disgust,undefined
Do you want to tell me about it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah.,Client,neutral,undefined
Perhaps it will help you,Client,neutral,undefined
to make sense of my feelings.,Client,neutral,undefined
I hope so.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I saw my son Arun,Client,neutral,undefined
lying on the street in front of the house.,Client,neutral,undefined
And he was unconscious.,Client,neutral,undefined
"The children were inside,",Client,neutral,undefined
looking out the window. They were afraid.,Client,neutral,undefined
Beyond the street there was a forest,Client,neutral,undefined
of thick black trees.,Client,neutral,undefined
And a woman with long dark hair,Client,neutral,undefined
came walking out of the forest.,Client,neutral,undefined
"She wore a long white gown,",Client,neutral,undefined
bright as the moon.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I was standing over my son.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And as the woman started walking towards the house,",Client,neutral,undefined
I was trying to hold my son's arm.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I pulled it,Client,neutral,undefined
and it broke cleanly off,Client,neutral,undefined
like a piece of old plaster.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I was thinking that I should use this arm,Client,neutral,undefined
to protect the children.,Client,neutral,undefined
To protect the children from this woman?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Now the arm was quite heavy, dense.",Client,neutral,undefined
I could hurt this woman very much.,Client,neutral,undefined
And...,Client,neutral,undefined
I woke up,Client,neutral,undefined
as I was about to strike her.,Client,neutral,undefined
So you were going to strike this woman,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to protect your grandchildren?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm quite confused by this woman.,Client,depression,undefined
Who do you think she could be?,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, sometimes it's not so much",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the physical similarity as the feeling.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you think it could be Julia?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, she had dark hair.",Client,neutral,undefined
"It was dark, black as onyx.",Client,neutral,undefined
And Julia's hair is yellow.,Client,neutral,undefined
Perhaps it was Julia in disguise.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is that how you see Julia... in disguise?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Do you see her as a threat?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She has a secret life.,Client,neutral,undefined
The woman was most definitely not Kamala.,Client,neutral,undefined
What makes you so sure of that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I would never think of harming my wife.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you feel that you could harm Julia?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The thing I found strange was,Client,depression,undefined
that I could not make out the details of the woman's face,Client,depression,undefined
even when she drew very close.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, I started to grip my son's arm with great force.",Client,depression,undefined
I could feel the blood pulsing into my hands.,Client,depression,undefined
And she was so close,Client,depression,undefined
"that I could almost smell the flower she wore in her hair,",Client,depression,undefined
but I could not see her face.,Client,depression,undefined
The flower in her hair like in the El Greco painting?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Sorry?,Client,depression,undefined
That's the painting you mentioned,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
when you first spoke of Malini.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What do you mean?,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, you've just spoken about her death",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
after 32 years of silence.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's not surprising that some form of her...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
even the slightest gesture or detail...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
might show up in your dream.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Like a rabbit in a hat?,Client,disgust,undefined
"Bong! Oh, there she is.",Client,disgust,undefined
You said that you felt you had this need,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to protect your grandchildren.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You said you felt the blood rushing into your hands,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and that you were prepared,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
to harm this woman.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"See, Paul, I no longer wish to discuss this dream.",Client,disgust,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Can I ask you why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I cannot see the point of this exercise.,Client,disgust,undefined
But I'm confused.A moment ago you asked me,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"to help you understand these nightmares that you're having,",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
to help you make sense of the feelings that you're having.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
So that's what I'd like to do.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"For instance, this woman coming from the forest...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's clear that she has a big effect on you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you... you disagree with that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"See, the image of you removing your son's arm...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, sometimes there's something primal",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or animalistic,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
<i>that dreams allow us to express,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that our conscious mind is...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
( shouting in bengali ),Client,anger,undefined
A man can only be pushed so far.,Client,anger,undefined
I have decided it was not Malini in my dream.,Client,anger,undefined
And it upsets me very much for you to suggest this.,Client,anger,undefined
I... I...,Client,anger,undefined
I would never ever think of harming Malini.,Client,anger,undefined
Why would you think I would assume you'd hurt Malini?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Okay, we don't have to talk about that now.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
( Speaks bengali ),Client,anger,undefined
I don't understand what you're saying.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
You have no idea what my life has been.,Client,anger,undefined
But I want to understand. I want to know.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
Can I ask you what you did,Therapist,neutral,Open question
when you woke up from the dream?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I checked on the children.,Client,neutral,undefined
"They were fine, sleeping.",Client,neutral,undefined
I then went down to Julia's room.,Client,neutral,undefined
I could not resist. I wanted to check,Client,neutral,undefined
to see if her door was in fact locked.,Client,neutral,undefined
And?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was.,Client,neutral,undefined
What would you have done if her door wasn't locked?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Her door would not open, and this is all that matters.",Client,neutral,undefined
"No, but I'm asking you, what would you have done",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
if the door had been open?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I thought of calling you.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why didn't you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was the middle of the night.,Client,neutral,undefined
And things felt,Client,neutral,undefined
out of balance.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then I went upstairs to my room,Client,neutral,undefined
and I wrote to Kamala.,Client,neutral,undefined
Can I ask you what you wrote?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I really did consider calling you.,Client,neutral,undefined
The next time I want you to do that.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Okay?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"Yeah, perhaps.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Sunil, there's so much going on",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
in your life at the moment:,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You've lost your wife.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You've started to talk about a love affair,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that ended in tragedy.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You're worried about your son.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You're worried about your grandchildren.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You have these conflicted ideas,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
about your daughter-in-law.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You're anxious about the floods,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
in your homeland... in India.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I'm concerned about you, Sunil...",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that with all of these intense feelings,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
coming to the surface,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I understand how difficult it could be,Therapist,neutral,Approval
for you to stay in control.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
And I... I want to suggest,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
that you consider coming here,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"a little more often, maybe twice a week.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You think I'm going crazy?,Client,depression,undefined
"No no no no, you're not... you're not crazy,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
I assure you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I have patients who come to see me two-three times a week,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but it doesn't mean they're crazy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's just that they can benefit,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"from working more on themselves,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
going deeper with therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Julia and Arun...,Client,depression,undefined
they have done enough for me.,Client,depression,undefined
And I would prefer,Client,depression,undefined
not to ask anything more than this.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, would you like me to talk to them for you?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No no, please. I would not prefer that.",Client,depression,undefined
"Do you pray, Paul?",Client,neutral,undefined
Do I... do I pray?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yes.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Sometimes, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
Then please pray.,Client,neutral,undefined
For what?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
For the rains to stop in India.,Client,neutral,undefined
Is this normal?,Client,neutral,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"For it to be so hard to get started,",Client,neutral,undefined
"you know, to sit here for so long and not say anything?",Client,neutral,undefined
"It's actually only been a minute or two,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"but yeah, it's quite common.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"If I didn't say anything for the whole hour,",Client,neutral,undefined
would you say something eventually,Client,neutral,undefined
or would you just sit there?,Client,neutral,undefined
45 minutes later...,Client,neutral,undefined
It's time. We'll pick up here next week.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Eventually I would say something, yeah,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but the silences are instructive.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
How long before you intervene? What's the record?,Client,neutral,undefined
What's the longest silence by a patient?,Client,neutral,undefined
20-25 minutes.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah?,Client,neutral,undefined
Who blinked first?,Client,neutral,undefined
I did.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Finally I said, what are you thinking about?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"And she said, I've just been sitting here",Therapist,neutral,Approval
wondering when you were gonna say something.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So what are you thinking about?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So last week as you were leaving,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"you said that you'd gotten the results of your test,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but you hadn't looked at them yet.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm not ready to talk about that yet.,Client,neutral,undefined
How come?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Did you look at the results?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Izzy...,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sitting here thinking about Izzy.,Client,neutral,undefined
You've heard from her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Only when she wants something.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Last week I got an email, a text,",Client,neutral,undefined
three messages on my voicemail.,Client,neutral,undefined
It's more communication than I've had from her in months.,Client,neutral,undefined
She wanted to download some music and needed my password.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, maybe that was her way of breaking the ice.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Oh, by whining and begging,",Client,neutral,undefined
issuing demands?,Client,neutral,undefined
You sound like you're kind of angry with her.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Maybe it's time you to see her.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I did.,Client,neutral,undefined
When?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
This week.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I had her scarf, remember?",Client,neutral,undefined
"Oh yes, the one that you took from Tricia's.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
And some other things. I had a t-shirt that she loved,Client,neutral,undefined
and some paperbacks. I stuffed them all in a backpack,Client,neutral,undefined
and I went down to her school and ambushed her.,Client,neutral,undefined
Ambushed her?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, if I'd told her I was coming,",Client,neutral,undefined
she never would have stayed put.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Anyway, she was out front,",Client,joy,undefined
chatting with some friends on the steps.,Client,joy,undefined
"She looked very grown-up,",Client,joy,undefined
"chic,",Client,joy,undefined
full of life.,Client,joy,undefined
I just stood there and watched her for a few minutes.,Client,joy,undefined
And what was that like?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It was sort of surreal.,Client,joy,undefined
It was like looking into the future.,Client,joy,undefined
Who is this young woman?,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, where'd she come from?",Client,joy,undefined
I don't know. She...,Client,joy,undefined
"She looked sort of confused when she saw me, surprised.",Client,joy,undefined
Her friends were gawking.,Client,joy,undefined
And then this confident young woman,Client,joy,undefined
just evaporated in front of my eyes,Client,joy,undefined
"and she went back to being this sullen, obnoxious little...",Client,joy,undefined
"Well, they're grown-ups around their friends.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But they're... they're still children with us.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Did you speak to her?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
She always licks her lips,Client,joy,undefined
"when she gets nervous, you know? It's compulsive.",Client,joy,undefined
She did it all the time when she was a child.,Client,joy,undefined
She used to have this red ring of irritation around her mouth.,Client,joy,undefined
She started doing that when she was talking to me.,Client,joy,undefined
"I said, honey, don't do that,",Client,joy,undefined
and I offered her some chapstick.,Client,joy,undefined
You would have thought that I tried,Client,joy,undefined
to scald her with a hot poker.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, she just fled.",Client,joy,undefined
And did that hurt you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Oh no.,Client,joy,undefined
I'm used to stuff like that. That didn't hurt me.,Client,joy,undefined
What she did after hurt me.,Client,joy,undefined
What did she do?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
She texted me.,Client,joy,undefined
Thanks for bringing the scarf.,Client,joy,undefined
You should call Trish. She's really sick now.,Client,depression,undefined
She looks like a skeleton.,Client,depression,undefined
It's always about Trish.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, I haven't seen my daughter for months...",Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, not really, not in any meaningful way.",Client,depression,undefined
She's been spending every waking minute with my sister.,Client,depression,undefined
"I finally reach out to her. I see her once,",Client,depression,undefined
and what does she do? She texts me about Trish.,Client,depression,undefined
How did you feel when you heard,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that Patricia looked like a skeleton?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, how do you think I felt?",Client,depression,undefined
"I don't know. I'm finding it kind of hard to read your reaction,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
but I imagine that it must have been hard to hear.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It was very hard. I couldn't even take it in.,Client,depression,undefined
"I just texted Izzy back and said,",Client,depression,undefined
"you know, great seeing you, darling.",Client,depression,undefined
And I'll call Trish after the show.,Client,depression,undefined
And did you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Why? You agree with Izzy?,Client,depression,undefined
You think I should call my sister?,Client,depression,undefined
"Yes, I do.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
I think that you should call your sister.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Well, I went out and got laid instead.",Client,depression,undefined
"I know, I know you're judging me,",Client,depression,undefined
but I don't care.,Client,depression,undefined
I haven't been with anyone since Russell.,Client,depression,undefined
25 and very handsome.,Client,depression,undefined
No body fat... none.,Client,depression,undefined
"Actually I was a little worried. I thought,",Client,depression,undefined
I wonder if he gets cold in the winter.,Client,depression,undefined
"Part of me wanted to fuck him,",Client,joy,undefined
part of me wanted to take him home and wrap him in a blanket,Client,joy,undefined
and give him a great big meal.,Client,joy,undefined
It was that maternal-erotic thing,Client,joy,undefined
you were talking about.,Client,joy,undefined
So this man that you...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Oh, he's in the cast... Eddie, Eduardo.",Client,joy,undefined
"Well, you know the script, right?",Client,joy,undefined
He is one of Maxine's houseboys.,Client,joy,undefined
After the preview I went out for a quick drink with the cast.,Client,joy,undefined
"And I was gonna call Tricia afterwards, when I got home.",Client,joy,undefined
I knew she'd be up. She sleeps during the day,Client,joy,undefined
"and then she's up at night... you know, the morphine.",Client,joy,undefined
"You haven't done that before, have you... gone out with the cast?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, they've been bugging me.",Client,joy,undefined
I've just been avoiding it.,Client,joy,undefined
( Sighs ),Client,joy,undefined
He kept buying me martinis.,Client,joy,undefined
I'm a lightweight. I only need one drink.,Client,joy,undefined
But halfway through the third I asked him to show me,Client,joy,undefined
"where he lived, just like that.",Client,joy,undefined
Wasn't that bold of me?,Client,joy,undefined
Do you think it was the alcohol that made you bold?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Didn't hurt.,Client,joy,undefined
Two years.,Client,joy,undefined
"I kept telling myself, don't worry, Frances,",Client,joy,undefined
it's like riding a bicycle.,Client,joy,undefined
And was it?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"He took off my shirt and touched me,",Client,joy,undefined
and I thought I was gonna lose it.,Client,joy,undefined
"I mean, he loved my breasts.",Client,joy,undefined
You sound surprised.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I'm not 25 or synthetic, if you know what I mean.",Client,joy,undefined
And he just kept kissing them,Client,joy,undefined
and touching them.,Client,joy,undefined
"Well, I forgot how sensitive they are.",Client,joy,undefined
Are you shocked?,Client,joy,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Oh please.,Client,joy,undefined
Are you trying to shock me?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"No, I just know how squeamish you are.",Client,neutral,undefined
What about my behavior would make you think I'm squeamish?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, your whole life seems squeamish to me.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, no wonder Trish loved you so much.",Client,neutral,undefined
She always had a thing for repressed men.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm... I'm struck by the fact,Therapist,neutral,Approval
that you went out,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and that you had sex,Therapist,neutral,Open question
for the first time in two years,Therapist,neutral,Approval
when you were confronted by the very real image,Therapist,neutral,Open question
of your sister being sick...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
very sick.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What's the connection between the two events?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I wanted to feel good instead of bad.,Client,neutral,undefined
Do you think there might be anything else?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, but clearly you do.",Client,neutral,undefined
So why don't you just tell me what it is?,Client,neutral,undefined
"Well, let me ask you something:",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Had you opened your test results by that night?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
No.,Client,neutral,undefined
Have you opened them since?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
The first thing that you mentioned,Therapist,neutral,Approval
about having sex with this man,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
was how good he made your breasts feel.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I know that you've talked about,Therapist,neutral,Approval
not being able to imagine having mastectomies,Therapist,neutral,Approval
if the test proved positive.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you think you might have been looking,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"to shield yourself,to arm yourself",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"with reasons not to have the operation,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to be reminded that your breasts,Therapist,neutral,Approval
are sensual,Therapist,neutral,Approval
and that you cannot imagine,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
ever losing them?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I thought about reading the results,Client,neutral,undefined
after sleeping with Eddie.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I thought, you know, time to face reality.",Client,neutral,undefined
I left there at 3:00 A.M.,Client,neutral,undefined
I just... I couldn't stay any longer.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"I was just lying awake, staring at him.",Client,neutral,undefined
He was tangled in the sheets.,Client,neutral,undefined
He looked so impossibly young.,Client,neutral,undefined
So how did you feel when you went home?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You told me before,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that your house felt empty.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"No, I was relieved.",Client,neutral,undefined
It was good to be alone after all that intimacy.,Client,neutral,undefined
I got home. I put on some Lucinda Williams.,Client,neutral,undefined
"That seemed appropriate, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined
She's all about heartbreak and longing.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I smoked a little pot.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I sat there staring at the envelope.,Client,neutral,undefined
So did you open it?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I couldn't. I mean,",Client,neutral,undefined
"I'll open this envelope, I thought,",Client,neutral,undefined
"and I'll find out I'm gonna be dead in five years,",Client,neutral,undefined
and then what? Who am I gonna call,Client,neutral,undefined
to help me through this?,Client,neutral,undefined
So I just sat there staring at it.,Client,neutral,undefined
And then the pot eventually made me sleepy.,Client,depression,undefined
I went to bed.,Client,depression,undefined
So who do you think of when you say,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that you want somebody to get you through this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"I don't know. I mean, Tricia's got",Client,depression,undefined
all these people getting her through it.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, she's got my daughter, right?",Client,depression,undefined
She's got an army of girlfriends on top of that.,Client,depression,undefined
"She's probably got Russell, you know,",Client,depression,undefined
delivering meals or something.,Client,depression,undefined
He always wished that I could be more like her.,Client,depression,undefined
Why do you say that?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Oh, just the way they'd look at each other",Client,depression,undefined
when she'd come over for dinner... I knew.,Client,depression,undefined
Are you saying that they looked at each other,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"in, what, a sexual way?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, Russell would never have slept with her.",Client,depression,undefined
She wasn't beautiful enough.,Client,depression,undefined
She set us up because she wanted to keep him in her life.,Client,depression,undefined
Are you suggesting that Tricia used you to stay close to Russell,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
for some kind of emotional affair?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You think she's so perfect, you know.",Client,depression,undefined
Tricia has everybody convinced she's some kind of a Saint.,Client,depression,undefined
Except you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You don't see her like that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Guess who else had sex this weekend.,Client,depression,undefined
Izzy and Miller.,Client,depression,undefined
How do you know that?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Izzy emailed Trish. Yeah, she wrote,",Client,depression,undefined
I'm glad we got that over with.,Client,depression,undefined
It wasn't as bad as I imagined it would be.,Client,depression,undefined
What's gonna happen to that girl?,Client,depression,undefined
"First her grandmother, then her aunt,",Client,depression,undefined
quite possibly her mom.,Client,depression,undefined
She's gonna feel doomed.,Client,depression,undefined
Doomed to lose her mother?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Tricia's favorite statistic...,Client,depression,undefined
87% chance that you'll get breast cancer,Client,depression,undefined
if you test positive for the gene.,Client,depression,undefined
That's my fate.,Client,depression,undefined
But that doesn't have to be your fate.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Izzy doesn't have to be doomed to lose her mother.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"So you still feel, if the test is positive,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you'd rather develop cancer,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
than have your breasts removed?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Yes.,Client,depression,undefined
And what if you do develop cancer?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Trish was a fool...,Client,depression,undefined
a double mastectomy for what?,Client,depression,undefined
I'm guessing she thought it might save her life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah well, it didn't.",Client,depression,undefined
She spent the last year of her life looking like...,Client,depression,undefined
My mother knew better.,Client,depression,undefined
"She refused, you know.",Client,depression,undefined
"When they found the tumor, she had a lumpectomy finally,",Client,depression,undefined
but she did not let the doctors take her breasts.,Client,depression,undefined
And you understood her decision.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I did.,Client,depression,undefined
I think Tricia had those operations,Client,depression,undefined
"just to spite mama,",Client,depression,undefined
"you know, to reject her vanity.",Client,depression,undefined
"And by extension reject yours,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
just like Izzy rejects you...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yes.,Client,depression,undefined
...Shaving her head in solidarity with your sister.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You talked about having no one,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to get you through opening your test results.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you really feel that if you asked Izzy,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that she would say no?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Would you please read this?,Client,fear,undefined
These are your test results?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Yes.,Client,fear,undefined
Are you sure that you...?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Yes.,Client,fear,undefined
"You know, I'm happy to be here for you.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm happy to do this with you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
But I think that you should open the letter.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Client,fear,undefined
You don't have to tell me what it says.,Client,fear,undefined
"Just open it, okay?",Client,fear,undefined
Maybe we should just...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"What, talk about why I want you to do this, Paul?",Client,fear,undefined
"Just do it, please. We can talk about it afterwards.",Client,fear,undefined
What does it say?,Client,fear,undefined
"Read it, Frances.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Please.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
It's negative.,Client,fear,undefined
Is it negative?,Client,fear,undefined
"Am I reading it right, Paul? Is this...?",Client,fear,undefined
That's what it says.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Oh my God.,Client,fear,undefined
I'm very relieved.,Client,fear,undefined
Thank you. Thank you.,Client,fear,undefined
"Yes, it must be a huge weight lifted.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
This means Izzy too.,Client,fear,undefined
Does it?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
That would have been her inheritance... cancer.,Client,fear,undefined
It's unbelievable really. Isn't this unbelievable?,Client,fear,undefined
"Yes, it's... it's great news, yes.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
And not only are you now freed,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"from this awful worry about Izzy,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"about your own health,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
but you can now go see your sister.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What is that supposed to mean?,Client,neutral,undefined
You no longer have to fear,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that she'll torment you about having that procedure.,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"No no, I can't see my sister.",Client,neutral,undefined
Why not?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm not going to see my sister,Client,neutral,undefined
because she'll ask about this.,Client,neutral,undefined
She'll ask about the results.,Client,neutral,undefined
And I'll have to tell her the truth. I can't lie to Tricia.,Client,neutral,undefined
Why would you not want to tell her about the results? They're good.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They're the best possible outcome. They couldn't be better.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"She's dying, okay? How would you like it",Client,neutral,undefined
"if you were dying and I came to you and said,",Client,neutral,undefined
"hey, guess what. I get to live.",Client,neutral,undefined
"If that person were my sister, I would be very very glad.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
Patricia will be relieved,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"knowing that Izzy will have a mother,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"knowing, in all likelihood,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that you'll live an average lifespan.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
How do you know what her reaction will be?,Client,neutral,undefined
"I don't really know. I'm just predicting,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
knowing what I know about Patricia.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
That would be a normal response.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Oh, I thought you're not supposed to use words like normal.",Client,neutral,undefined
"Okay, let me put this as plainly as I possibly can.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You need to see your sister before she dies.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You don't have any reason not to.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
The reason you thought you had no longer exists.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Well, I don't want to hurt her.",Client,neutral,undefined
She won't be hurt. She'll be pleased.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"You know, I hope she's more pleased than you are.",Client,neutral,undefined
"I mean, don't you think you could be a little happier for me?",Client,neutral,undefined
I know that you've been expecting the worst possible outcome.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"You've been preparing yourself for bad news, understandably.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
But you cannot let your confusion,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or the mixed feelings that you have,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
about this genuinely good news,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
stand in the way of dealing with your sister.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You need to see your sister before she dies.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Oh, you know, what the hell happened",Client,fear,undefined
between the two of you anyway?,Client,fear,undefined
Sorry?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, the way you talk about her...",Client,fear,undefined
It's like you're still in love with her.,Client,fear,undefined
Still? Why do you say that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, that's what she told me...",Client,fear,undefined
that you were in love with her,Client,fear,undefined
back then.,Client,fear,undefined
Were you?,Client,fear,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, she thinks you were.",Client,fear,undefined
So clearly she's deluded.,Client,fear,undefined
She was in love with you.,Client,fear,undefined
You are so angry with your sister.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Is it because she's dying,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and she needs you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"and you're scared that you won't be able to help her,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"that you won't even be able to stay in the room with her,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that her illness will be too much for you to bear,Therapist,neutral,Open question
and you'll run away from her just as you ran away from your mother?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It'll kill me.,Client,fear,undefined
It won't kill you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"It's all gone, Paul... her eyelashes, her hair,",Client,fear,undefined
her breasts... gone. It'll kill me.,Client,fear,undefined
"She's the one who's dying, not you.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It is not gonna kill you.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"If you don't do it now, you'll always regret it.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Do you want to tell me what happened?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I called him after our session.,Client,anger,undefined
Who? Kevin?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And I said I was ready to meet him.,Client,anger,undefined
"And he was like, great, we'll meet you in the city.",Client,anger,undefined
"But I kinda wanted to see their place,",Client,anger,undefined
"so I said I would come to them. And he was like, great.",Client,anger,undefined
"And I was like, how's tuesday?",Client,anger,undefined
"And he was like, tuesday's great.",Client,anger,undefined
When did you call him? After the last session?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah.,Client,anger,undefined
And why did you feel the urgency?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know.,Client,anger,undefined
I just felt good after last week.,Client,anger,undefined
I felt like maybe it was all gonna work out somehow.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, you know, we had talked about spending another few sessions...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
what are you saying?,Client,anger,undefined
Are you saying that I fucked up?,Client,anger,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Do you want me to leave?,Client,anger,undefined
"No, I don't.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Because I don't feel like you really want me here.,Client,anger,undefined
I don't feel like you actually want to hear what happened to me.,Client,anger,undefined
"Jesse, I do want to hear.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yeah, so...",Client,anger,undefined
"We were supposed to meet today at, like, 6:00.",Client,disgust,undefined
"But I'm always late for things,",Client,disgust,undefined
so I thought I would just show up early,Client,disgust,undefined
and scope the place out and then I'd get some coffee.,Client,disgust,undefined
So I took a 3:00 train.,Client,disgust,undefined
It only took an hour.,Client,disgust,undefined
Jesse?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
There were these kids in the front yard.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And at first I thought,",Client,disgust,undefined
it must be the wrong house.,Client,disgust,undefined
But I checked the address and it wasn't.,Client,disgust,undefined
"I mean, it was the right house.",Client,disgust,undefined
And then I thought,Client,disgust,undefined
maybe they were the neighbors' kids or...,Client,disgust,undefined
So I looked at them up close,Client,disgust,undefined
through the zoom lens of my camera.,Client,disgust,undefined
I took some pictures.,Client,disgust,undefined
And then I felt really ill.,Client,disgust,undefined
So I left.,Client,disgust,undefined
"And I went to find a diner or something,",Client,disgust,undefined
"somewhere where I could think,",Client,disgust,undefined
but apparently there are no diners in Westchester.,Client,disgust,undefined
"There are 50 million different tennis clubs,",Client,disgust,undefined
but you can't get a fucking milk shake!,Client,disgust,undefined
Okay okay.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
So what did you do?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I...,Client,disgust,undefined
I walked around for a couple of hours,Client,disgust,undefined
and then I went back.,Client,disgust,undefined
And they were gone.,Client,disgust,undefined
Who was gone?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Everybody was gone?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"No, Kevin and Karen were still there, but...",Client,disgust,undefined
The kids... they just disappeared...,Client,disgust,undefined
"and not just, like, their physical bodies,",Client,disgust,undefined
but all evidence of their existences.,Client,disgust,undefined
There was this chalk. And the girl...,Client,anger,undefined
she was drawing on the driveway with it.,Client,anger,undefined
And the chalk was gone.,Client,anger,undefined
And the girl was gone. And the driveway was wet.,Client,anger,undefined
"They washed it, Paul.",Client,anger,undefined
So I rang the doorbell.,Client,anger,undefined
Kevin answered.,Client,anger,undefined
Kevin?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
So what was he like?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
He was blond and tall.,Client,anger,undefined
They were...,Client,anger,undefined
they looked...,Client,anger,undefined
Rich.,Client,anger,undefined
And what else?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"Uh, she...",Client,anger,undefined
she had really nice legs.,Client,anger,undefined
Is it weird that I noticed that?,Client,anger,undefined
No.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
She was wearing these stockings and...,Client,anger,undefined
She had this round face and these little eyes,Client,anger,undefined
that disappeared into her skull,Client,anger,undefined
every time she smiled.,Client,anger,undefined
He... he looked like a really good guy.,Client,anger,undefined
He had a wink...,Client,anger,undefined
Like that.,Client,anger,undefined
So did they...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
did they invite you in?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, and we sat at the kitchen table.",Client,anger,undefined
And they put out these oreo cookies and milk,Client,anger,undefined
like we were in a fucking nabisco commercial.,Client,anger,undefined
So you found that patronizing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, I mean,",Client,anger,undefined
I was starving,Client,anger,undefined
"so I ate, like, half the package, but...",Client,anger,undefined
what did you talk about,Therapist,neutral,Open question
when you were eating the cookies?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't really remember.,Client,anger,undefined
You don't remember?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was just looking around the room.,Client,anger,undefined
"And they were, like, watching me.",Client,anger,undefined
What were you looking for?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Drawings on the refrigerator,",Client,anger,undefined
sippy cups. I don't know.,Client,anger,undefined
Were you looking for signs,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
of other kids?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, and?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
The outlets were childproof.,Client,anger,undefined
Anything else?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You were convinced that the kids in the yard,Therapist,neutral,Open question
were definitely their kids?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They... they just like held hands the whole time,Client,anger,undefined
and they looked at me like...,Client,anger,undefined
like I was gonna set their house on fire or something.,Client,anger,undefined
"And then, like, 10 minutes later",Client,anger,undefined
"they asked me to leave, so I left.",Client,anger,undefined
I I can't believe I wore I this jacket. Up.,Client,depression,undefined
I haven't worn it since freshman year.,Client,depression,undefined
And this tie isn't even mine. It's Nate's.,Client,depression,undefined
"I tied him up with it once and I got come on it,",Client,depression,undefined
so he said I could keep it.,Client,depression,undefined
"Those were their kids, Paul.",Client,depression,undefined
Do you want to know how I know?,Client,depression,undefined
How?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I went to the bathroom before I left.,Client,depression,undefined
I went a couple of times.,Client,depression,undefined
There was this bar,Client,depression,undefined
by the toilet for handicapped people.,Client,depression,undefined
Jesus.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills
"I know, right?",Client,depression,undefined
At least now we know why they got in contact with me.,Client,depression,undefined
Isn't it obvious?,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
This kid in the wheelchair...,Client,depression,undefined
look at his face. He's like a mini me.,Client,depression,undefined
And he's fucking sickly.,Client,sadness,undefined
They want my blood...,Client,sadness,undefined
My guts... something. I don't know.,Client,sadness,undefined
Are you saying that they got in touch with you,Therapist,neutral,Open question
because of some medical reason?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Yeah, of course. He's dying.",Client,sadness,undefined
He probably needs a donor or something.,Client,sadness,undefined
"Okay, let's...",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
let's take a...,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
"take a step back here, Jesse.",Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation
How do you know the kid's dying?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Look at him.,Client,sadness,undefined
I see a kid in a wheelchair.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
He might have had an accident. He might be paralyzed.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
There's a number of things that might be wrong,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that aren't life-threatening.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
But why would they get in touch with me after 17 years?,Client,sadness,undefined
And why would they hide their kids from me?,Client,sadness,undefined
Maybe they just wanted to meet you first.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
They washed the fucking driveway!,Client,depression,undefined
"Okay, that's...",Therapist,neutral,Open question
that's strange.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
You're right.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
But let's not leap to conclusions here.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
Tell me everything that you remember,Therapist,neutral,Approval
about the conversation.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I already told you.,Client,depression,undefined
You just told me they had cookies and they were holding hands.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"What did they actually say, Jesse?",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't remember what they said.,Client,depression,undefined
Nothing?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I was stoned.,Client,depression,undefined
You were stoned?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
Kinda. A little bit.,Client,depression,undefined
I got high while I was walking around wasting time.,Client,depression,undefined
Maybe that's why you were so hungry.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, I guess so.",Client,depression,undefined
You said they asked you to leave the house.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You remember that.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Yeah.,Client,depression,undefined
And do you have any idea why?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I think it had something to do with RISD.,Client,depression,undefined
RISD?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Did you ask them for money?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Kinda.,Client,depression,undefined
"Well, what does kinda mean?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I said that maybe we could work out some sort of deal.,Client,depression,undefined
A deal? Like...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Like a summer for some bone marrow.,Client,depression,undefined
"If they paid for college, I'd throw in a kidney.",Client,depression,undefined
I don't know.,Client,depression,undefined
And what did they say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
They didn't really say anything.,Client,depression,undefined
"Kevin offered to drive me to the train station,",Client,depression,undefined
so I left.,Client,depression,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You know what? I've got to say that I'm...,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
"what, frustrated with me?",Client,depression,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure
I think you deliberately sabotaged that meeting.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"No, I didn't.",Client,depression,undefined
I can't help but feel that it's another event,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"in the pattern of your behavior,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that you test everybody around you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and then you push them away,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
like you did with Marisa and Roberto and Nate.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Now it's your birth parents.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You hurt the people who care about you,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"so that they will turn away from you,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
and then you can prove to yourself,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that you're fundamentally unlovable.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Sorry, I didn't know that I did that.",Client,depression,undefined
Even coming over here now... it's late.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's not your session time.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Were you testing me to see how much I care,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
what I'm willing to sacrifice?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Will I put my kid's needs before you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Jesse, don't walk out. Jesse.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Jesse, don't walk out.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
"Jesse, stop.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
The only reason I came here tonight is because,Client,depression,undefined
I thought you should know how much you fucked up my fucking life.,Client,depression,undefined
If I hadn't taken your stupid advice...,Client,depression,undefined
IWhat advice?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You told me to call them back.,Client,depression,undefined
"No, I didn't.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Yes, you did. I was gonna tell them to fuck off.",Client,depression,undefined
You gave it to me.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Stop it! Just fucking stop.,Client,anger,undefined
"I'm the one in trouble here, okay? Not you.",Client,anger,undefined
Why don't you go back to your little pancakefest with your faggoty son!,Client,anger,undefined
You know...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Your birth parents...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
they made a mistake,Therapist,neutral,Open question
by not telling you that you had siblings.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I don't know what their intentions were.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Maybe they were trying to protect you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Did I just ruin everything?,Client,anger,undefined
What do you mean by everything?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
My whole life.,Client,anger,undefined
"Jesse, you're 17.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
You didn't kill anybody.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You haven't ruined your life.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"But you made a decision and you took an action,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and that action has consequences.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
They kept a crippled kid.,Client,anger,undefined
"God, what is wrong with me?",Client,anger,undefined
"There's nothing wrong with you, Jess... nothing.",Therapist,neutral,Approval
There must be something.,Client,anger,undefined
How old were Kevin and Karen when you were born?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Didn't he say in his letter?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"Uh, like, 17.",Client,anger,undefined
"17, Jesse... your age.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
Do you feel ready to raise a kid?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
No.,Client,anger,undefined
I know you think there's got to be some reason,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"why your birth parents gave you up,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
some secret,Therapist,neutral,Open question
that they're keeping from you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
What if they were just too young?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
What if it's that simple? What then?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I'm sorry.,Client,depression,undefined
More traffic?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Yeah, it got even worse after I called from the turnpike.",Client,depression,undefined
Just into Chinatown...,Client,depression,undefined
completely stalled out.,Client,depression,undefined
"I started thinking, this is it.",Client,depression,undefined
This is how I'm gonna spend the rest of my life... on canal street.,Client,depression,undefined
The parking was awful too.,Client,depression,undefined
Another headache?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I figured I'd keep this in your medicine cabinet.",Client,depression,undefined
"Then I can help myself when necessary,",Client,depression,undefined
if I can open this.,Client,depression,undefined
"Okay, that's it.",Client,depression,undefined
So what do we have left... half a session?,Client,depression,undefined
If that.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You've had a big day.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I got in the car and drove back.,Client,depression,undefined
Traffic started immediately.,Client,depression,undefined
I started to sweat. I thought I was having a heart attack.,Client,depression,undefined
"The last time you were here,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you hadn't been able to talk to Max,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"about your health, Steve and...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I talked to him.,Client,depression,undefined
What made you finally decide to?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You did.,Client,depression,undefined
At least in part.,Client,depression,undefined
"It took me till last night, but I finally,",Client,depression,undefined
"thanks to you,",Client,depression,undefined
forced myself to talk to him.,Client,depression,undefined
And?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
It was clear right away that this was,Client,depression,undefined
what he really wanted,Client,depression,undefined
and that he'd only come to stay with me,Client,depression,undefined
because he'd been worried about me,Client,depression,undefined
and that really he ought to be there.,Client,depression,undefined
In Maryland?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yeah, it was the only option,",Client,depression,undefined
"yeah,",Client,depression,undefined
as painful as was to realize that.,Client,depression,undefined
The two of you spoke just last night?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
The whole thing just happened so fast.,Client,depression,undefined
"You know, I guess I felt",Client,disgust,undefined
that he'd been up here a month,Client,disgust,undefined
and I just wanted to get him home for his sake,Client,disgust,undefined
and also to...,Client,disgust,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Get it over with.,Client,disgust,undefined
He asked me inside,Client,disgust,undefined
for coffee.,Client,disgust,undefined
You mean...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Steve.,Client,disgust,undefined
Kate wasn't there.,Client,disgust,undefined
"You know, he seemed...",Client,disgust,undefined
"he seemed, you know, okay...",Client,disgust,undefined
"all-American, you know,",Client,disgust,undefined
"a big smile, a strong handshake.",Client,disgust,undefined
"He looked, you know, like dad.",Client,disgust,undefined
Unlike you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Did you go in?,Client,disgust,undefined
I...,Client,disgust,undefined
I couldn't.,Client,disgust,undefined
I just had to get out of there.,Client,disgust,undefined
"It made it easier in some ways, you know...",Client,disgust,undefined
"his glaring decency,",Client,disgust,undefined
his ease with Max.,Client,disgust,undefined
And yet in other ways,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I can imagine that was very difficult to see.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I think maybe it was the hardest thing,Client,disgust,undefined
"I've ever had to do, you know...",Client,disgust,undefined
walk away from that house,Client,disgust,undefined
leaving Max behind,Client,disgust,undefined
with him.,Client,disgust,undefined
But after our session last week,Client,depression,undefined
I saw that...,Client,depression,undefined
"I saw that you were right,",Client,depression,undefined
"that I didn't have a choice,",Client,depression,undefined
that I had to face the truth.,Client,depression,undefined
"Will you tell me about your talk,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
how you got yourself to face the truth?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We were making pancakes late.,Client,depression,undefined
"And I was just beginning to get into it, you know,",Client,depression,undefined
trying to find the right words.,Client,depression,undefined
And the doorbell rings. And it's Jesse.,Client,depression,undefined
What time was this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I don't know. About 10:30 maybe.,Client,depression,undefined
And you let him in?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I had to.,Client,depression,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
He'd been to visit his birth parents,Client,depression,undefined
and they fucking rejected him.,Client,depression,undefined
The kid was devastated.,Client,depression,undefined
Did it feel easier for you to deal,Therapist,neutral,Open question
with Jesse's problems in your office,Therapist,neutral,Approval
than the ones with Max at home?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"If you'd seen what Jesse looked like, you would have let him in too.",Client,depression,undefined
"So I said to Max, okay look, we'll talk about this later.",Client,neutral,undefined
This is an emergency. I have to deal with it.,Client,neutral,undefined
We'll make the pancakes for breakfast.,Client,neutral,undefined
Then I went in. I spoke to Jesse.,Client,neutral,undefined
15 minutes later the smoke alarm goes off.,Client,neutral,undefined
I'm sorry?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
He'd tried to make the pancakes himself,Client,neutral,undefined
and the pan went on fire.,Client,neutral,undefined
So I put the flames out and I realized,Client,neutral,undefined
that I had to talk to my son.,Client,neutral,undefined
I... I... I... I couldn't wait any longer.,Client,neutral,undefined
You just told me you were determined to do it anyway.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
The point is that I did it.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Once Max set the stove on fire,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
once you left Jesse.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Oh, for fuck's sake.",Client,neutral,undefined
I'm telling you about this traumatic event,Client,disgust,undefined
where I finally faced up to something,Client,disgust,undefined
"that is extremely painful with my son,",Client,disgust,undefined
"maybe the lowest moment of my life,",Client,disgust,undefined
"which you have encouraged me to tackle,",Client,disgust,undefined
"which took all the strength that I had,",Client,disgust,undefined
and all you can do is focus,Client,disgust,undefined
on a mistake that you think I made...,Client,disgust,undefined
"that I, God forbid, tried to help a troubled patient?",Client,disgust,undefined
I do see how wrenching this was for you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I do.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"And at the same time, since you've walked in,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
I've been fully aware of your clear need,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
for me to grasp and acknowledge your pain.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Well, you are my therapist.",Client,disgust,undefined
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And I do happen to be in pain.,Client,disgust,undefined
I know that. I see that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You even brought in a prop,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to demonstrate in case I missed it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I do also have a fucking headache.",Client,disgust,undefined
I believe you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"But the more clearly I see the pain you're in,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
the greater the chance I'll see what you've done,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
as courageous and heroic,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and less of a chance that I'd question,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or criticize any part of it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, go ahead",Client,disgust,undefined
"and criticize,",Client,disgust,undefined
if that's what you feel the need to do.,Client,disgust,undefined
I do find I have some questions,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
regarding your decision about Max.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
What made it so urgent for you to finally bring him...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Can I say something?,Client,disgust,undefined
All right.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
You say that I seem to be looking,Client,disgust,undefined
"for a certain response from you,",Client,disgust,undefined
that I'm invested in your reaction.,Client,disgust,undefined
But you're avoiding,Client,depression,undefined
any acknowledgment,Client,depression,undefined
of why that might be.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm not sure I'm following.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I think you're dancing around the obvious reason,Client,depression,undefined
you might think that.,Client,depression,undefined
I would have thought you'd see the value,Client,depression,undefined
in addressing it directly.,Client,depression,undefined
What's the obvious reason?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You really need me to say it?,Client,depression,undefined
I'd like to hear what you think.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We both know as therapists,Client,depression,undefined
that that's the meat of all this anyway...,Client,depression,undefined
"not my day-to-day struggles, no matter how torturous,",Client,depression,undefined
"but what's actually happening right here,",Client,depression,undefined
what's going on in the room. I just...,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know. I find it strange that...,Client,depression,undefined
I find it strange that you haven't mentioned what happened last week.,Client,depression,undefined
"From your point of view,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
what happened at the end of last week?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You don't remember?,Client,depression,undefined
I remember our session quite well.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"So why the delicate evasion,",Client,depression,undefined
the muted suggestion?,Client,depression,undefined
You're talking about your pronouncement,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
of your feelings for me?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Have you been hurt by the fact,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
that I haven't brought up what we discussed last week?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I was just surprised,Client,depression,undefined
that you hadn't mentioned it.,Client,depression,undefined
The truth is,Client,depression,undefined
that this hasn't been foremost on my mind.,Client,depression,undefined
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Because for most of the week,Client,depression,undefined
I've been concentrated on my son.,Client,depression,undefined
I mean,Client,depression,undefined
you weren't even on my radar.,Client,depression,undefined
And...,Client,depression,undefined
I thought those thoughts had disappeared.,Client,depression,undefined
But they hadn't?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
They came back somewhere in Delaware.,Client,depression,undefined
"I was sitting in my car,",Client,depression,undefined
"just thinking about my life,",Client,depression,undefined
"my kids,",Client,depression,undefined
plus everything that awaited me when I got back here...,Client,depression,undefined
"Wendy, my work,",Client,depression,undefined
the next neurologist.,Client,depression,undefined
What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And I just realized,Client,depression,undefined
that the only person I wanted to see,Client,depression,undefined
when I got back to New York,Client,depression,undefined
was... was you.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm supposed to meet Wendy at my place for dinner.,Client,depression,undefined
"And all I could think was, I can't do it.",Client,depression,undefined
"Telling her what I went through today,",Client,depression,undefined
telling her what it was like to say goodbye to my son...,Client,depression,undefined
I just... I couldn't imagine it.,Client,depression,undefined
But I knew that you would understand.,Client,depression,undefined
Last week you spoke about these feelings,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"as ridiculous, a kind of comeuppance.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
It's true that I've seen this kind of thing before.,Client,depression,undefined
I'm familiar with the dynamic of transference.,Client,depression,undefined
And... and yet,Client,depression,undefined
I can't help but think,Client,depression,undefined
that maybe this is,Client,depression,undefined
something more.,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know. I just can't shake the thought,Client,depression,undefined
"that somehow,",Client,depression,undefined
someplace else,Client,depression,undefined
we might...,Client,depression,undefined
"we might be able to help each other,",Client,depression,undefined
that we might...,Client,depression,undefined
that we might make each other happy.,Client,depression,undefined
We might make each other happy.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
How do you imagine...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Look, I know",Client,depression,undefined
"it's impossible, of course",Client,depression,undefined
that you and I could never be together.,Client,depression,undefined
Impossible that we could never?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Impossible that we could ever...,Client,depression,undefined
there's no way it could happen.,Client,depression,undefined
I should have kept my mouth shut.,Client,depression,undefined
This impossibility...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
your certainty that a relationship between us,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
could never happen...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm wondering if in part,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
that's what allows you to contemplate it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"I mean, does it feel safer",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
within the confines of a therapist's office...,Therapist,neutral,Approval
of yours or mine...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"to allow yourself to engage in,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to imagine a personal relationship?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
Safer?,Client,depression,undefined
"I don't know about you, but I'm not feeling",Client,depression,undefined
particularly safe right now.,Client,depression,undefined
"When you think about us making each other happy,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
what comes to mind? What do you imagine?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
I...,Client,depression,undefined
I don't know. I... I...,Client,depression,undefined
tell me what you're thinking.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I suppose I just sense,Client,depression,undefined
that you and I...,Client,depression,undefined
"well,",Client,neutral,undefined
I... I imagine us having dinner,Client,neutral,undefined
"at the end of a day of work, you know,",Client,neutral,undefined
"having a glass of wine,",Client,neutral,undefined
"talking about our minor triumphs with patients,",Client,neutral,undefined
helping each other to sort through,Client,neutral,undefined
difficult cases.,Client,neutral,undefined
Anything else?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Are there other things you imagine,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
other romantic situations you might...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
"It's not so crazy, is it really,",Client,neutral,undefined
"to imagine sharing ideas, advice, encouragement",Client,neutral,undefined
with somebody who's,Client,neutral,undefined
"engaged in the same kind of work as a profession,",Client,neutral,undefined
seen the same challenges?,Client,neutral,undefined
"No, it's not crazy.",Therapist,neutral,Open question
No.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You know, for instance,",Client,neutral,undefined
I've been wanting to talk to you about Sunil.,Client,neutral,undefined
"I'm a little bit, I don't know, kind of...",Client,neutral,undefined
I've been thinking about my last session with him.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And I'm not quite sure what to make of it, you know?",Client,neutral,undefined
This is the kind of conversation,Therapist,neutral,Approval
you might imagine we would have,Therapist,neutral,Open question
if we were involved in some sort of relationship?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Look, I've told you about Sunil's anger,",Client,neutral,undefined
his... the deep rage that he has,Client,neutral,undefined
toward his daughter-in-law.,Client,neutral,undefined
"Yes, you did tell me,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
but because we're just about out of time...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and this week he told me this extremely vivid dream that he had,Client,neutral,undefined
where he imagined that he was defending his grandchildren,Client,neutral,undefined
"against this woman who was walking towards them,",Client,neutral,undefined
and he was trying to strike her.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And when I pressed him about this,",Client,neutral,undefined
he suddenly started to scream in bengali.,Client,neutral,undefined
"And obviously I didn't know what he was saying,",Client,neutral,undefined
"but then afterwards he said,",Client,neutral,undefined
a man can only be pushed so far.,Client,neutral,undefined
"It was just... I mean,",Client,neutral,undefined
do you think that I should be worried about...?,Client,neutral,undefined
I really couldn't answer that.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"I sit across from him and my gut instinct,",Client,anger,undefined
"you know, as a professional",Client,anger,undefined
is that he is... he is...,Client,anger,undefined
he is a gentle man.,Client,anger,undefined
But then he uses this kind of alarming language,Client,anger,undefined
like smother and strike.,Client,anger,undefined
What do you think? Am I wrong to consider,Client,anger,undefined
that he could become violent?,Client,anger,undefined
I honestly don't know. I've never met Sunil,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and I haven't heard the dream in any real detail.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"Well, I can fill you in on the...",Client,anger,undefined
"I'm afraid you can't, actually.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"But we could schedule another appointment,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
continue this next week.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't need another appointment.,Client,anger,undefined
"Well, there's a lot that came up today and there's not much time.",Therapist,neutral,Advisement
It's the end of the day. It's Friday.,Client,anger,undefined
I know that I'm your last patient.,Client,depression,undefined
If we could just...,Client,depression,undefined
How do you know you're my last patient?,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Because I stood outside last week,Client,depression,undefined
and I looked at the building.,Client,depression,undefined
"Nobody came in or out, including you, for an hour.",Client,depression,undefined
Well...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
We can talk about what you were thinking,Therapist,neutral,Approval
while you were standing outside my building next week.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
All I need is a minute or two,Client,depression,undefined
to address this issue of Sunil which...,Client,depression,undefined
his outburst was pretty ex...,Client,depression,undefined
"If we had two more minutes,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
this is what you'd like to discuss...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"your patient's outburst, not the fact that you stood",Therapist,neutral,Open question
"Yes, the depth of his anger,",Client,depression,undefined
his intensity... I need to know for my sake if you...,Client,depression,undefined
"if you're concerned about that,",Therapist,neutral,Open question
you know very well what you're supposed to do. You have...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm asking you to help me figure out whether I should be...,Client,depression,undefined
you have a duty to notify the authorities,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
or warn the potential victim. You know that already.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Now it's 5:53. We really need to stop.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
5:53?,Client,depression,undefined
05:53,Client,depression,undefined
How would 10:00 A.M. Monday morning work for you?,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I can't do it. I have a patient.,Client,depression,undefined
"All right, how about Wednesday at 1:00?",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I'm seeing a neurologist.,Client,depression,undefined
"And then I've got a 3:00, a 4:00, a 5:00.",Client,depression,undefined
I actually have a practice,Client,depression,undefined
where I routinely go five or 10 minutes over if necessary.,Client,depression,undefined
You're seeing another neurologist?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
About the Parkinson's?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I... why...? I don't understand,Client,depression,undefined
why you can't be just a little bit more flexible.,Client,depression,undefined
"I mean, think about it:",Client,depression,undefined
I've just lived through one of the worst moments of my life;,Client,depression,undefined
I've got a patient who potentially could hurt somebody and...,Client,depression,undefined
again if you believe that...,Therapist,neutral,Open question
And we've only had a half-an-hour session...,Client,depression,undefined
we've only had half a session because...,Therapist,neutral,Advisement
because I left my kid in Baltimore;,Client,depression,undefined
the traffic was insane and...,Client,depression,undefined
Paul.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
Why are you so fucking rigid?,Client,depression,undefined
You've got an enormous amount going on right now,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"and I would really like to help you see your way through,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but whenever I dare ask you to look at yourself,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"or your patterns of behavior,",Therapist,neutral,Approval
"you get angry, you raise your voice, you get impatient",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
and I think deeply afraid.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
You do anything you can to push our relationship,Therapist,neutral,Open question
past its prescribed time and purpose.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
"You ask me to be your colleague,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"your supervisor, your life partner...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
anything except for what you came to me for...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"to be your therapist,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
to get me to challenge you to look at yourself.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
I don't think you realize,Therapist,neutral,Approval
just how paralyzed you've become.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
"It took you weeks to speak to your son,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
and only after a real crisis,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
forced you to do it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
You have an inability,Therapist,neutral,Approval
to act decisively with one of your patients,Therapist,neutral,Open question
despite the fact that you say,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
you're genuinely concerned for him.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
You have doubts about your current relationship,Therapist,neutral,Approval
which you've done nothing about.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
And you've convinced yourself you have a debilitating disease,Therapist,neutral,Open question
despite medical opinions to the contrary.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
"Now I would really like to help you see your way through,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement
but I cannot do it alone and I will not do it past 5:50.,Therapist,neutral,Open question
Now I really urge you to come see me twice next week.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
I'm... I'm unable to do that.,Client,depression,undefined
All right then.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
For now we need to stop.,Therapist,neutral,Approval
Are you so paralyzed you're unable to stand up?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement
I'm standing.,Client,depression,undefined
And I'm leaving.,Client,depression,undefined
Your pills.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation
